  abstract = {Recent measurements at the National Geothermal Test Facility at East Mesa, California, and the Savannah River Plant, South Carolina, have spurred a renewed look at evaporation from heated water bodies. Theoretical analyses are provided for each of four evaporation regimes that could be experienced at heated ponds, ranging from free convective layers to forced convective layers. Differences among regimes are highlighted by calculations appropriate for the Savannah River site where water temperatures reach 70°C and underscore the difficulty in finding a single evaporation equation to adequately cover the entire range. Consequently, a new equation is developed which combines free and forced convection in a different manner from previous equations: evaporation is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the respective components. The new equation and several existing equations are compared with evaporation measured at water bodies at the Savannah River and the East Mesa sites.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of the CO2 output from arc volcanism requires a precise understanding of the potential along-arc variations in volcanic gas chemistry, and ultimately of the magmatic gas signature of each individual arc segment. In an attempt to more fully constrain the magmatic gas signature of the Central America Volcanic Arc (CAVA), we present here the results of a volcanic gas survey performed during March and April 2013 at five degassing volcanoes within the Costa Rica-Nicaragua volcanic segment (CNVS). Observations of the volcanic gas plume made with a multicomponent gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) have allowed characterization of the CO2/SO2-ratio signature of the plumes at Poás (0.30±0.06, mean ± SD), Rincón de la Vieja (27.0±15.3), and Turrialba (2.2±0.8) in Costa Rica, and at Telica (3.0±0.9) and San Cristóbal (4.2±1.3) in Nicaragua (all ratios on molar basis). By scaling these plume compositions to simultaneously measured SO2 fluxes, we estimate that the CO2 outputs at CNVS volcanoes range from low (25.5±11.0 tons/day at Poás) to moderate (918 to 1270 tons/day at Turrialba). These results add a new information to the still fragmentary volcanic CO2 output data set, and allow estimating the total CO2 output from the CNVS at 2835±1364 tons/day. Our novel results, with previously available information about gas emissions in Central America, are suggestive of distinct volcanic gas CO2/ST (= SO2 + H2S)-ratio signature for magmatic volatiles in Nicaragua (\textasciitilde 3) relative to Costa Rica (\textasciitilde 0.5-1.0). We also provide additional evidence for the earlier theory relating the CO2-richer signature of Nicaragua volcanism to increased contributions from slab-derived fluids, relative to more-MORB-like volcanism in Costa Rica. The sizeable along-arc variations in magmatic gas chemistry that the present study has suggested indicate that additional gas observations are urgently needed to more-precisely confine the volcanic CO2 from the CAVA, and from global arc volcanism.},

If, in addition, precursory increases in thermal emissions are observed, an integrated mechanistic model for volcanic activity may be developed with the potential for forecasting eruptions. Crater-lake volcanoes provide an interesting target for such studies since thermal output can be monitored simply through lake water calotimetry. Here we summarize 10 years of gravity and thermal data from PO\& volcano, Costa Rica. Mass/energy balance calculations demonstrate that, in the steady-state, the large thermal inertia of the crater lake acts as a buffer to short-term changes in the energy input from the cooling magma feeder pipe. Since February 1986, it is postulated that there has been gradual emplacement of a shallow magma intrusion associated with vesiculation and gas loss to the surface. This follows from unambiguous, gravity increases, constrained by elevation control, that are coincident in time with a period of long-term increased energy input to the crater lake. Progressive reduction of the lake volume by evaporation/seepage culminated in an (April 1989) ash eruption providing a good documented record of combined gravity and thermodynamic precursors to volcanic activity.},

  abstract = {Kuttara Volcano, Hokkaido, Japan, consists of temperate Lake Kuttara and the western Noboribetsu geothermal area. In order to explore geothermal relations between Lake Kuttara and the geothermal area, the heat budget of a hydrothermal pond, Okunoyu, was evaluated, and the heat storage change in the lower layer of Lake Kuttara was calculated by monitoring the water temperature at the deepest point. The lake water temperature consistently increased during the thermal stratification in June\&ndash;November of 2013\&ndash;2016. The heat flux QB at lake bottom was then calculated at a range of 4.1\&ndash;10.9 W/m2, which is probably due to the leakage from a hydrothermal reservoir below the lake bottom. Meanwhile, the heat flux HGin by geothermal groundwater input in Okunoyu was evaluated at 3.5\&ndash;8.5 kW/m2, which is rapidly supplied through faults from underlying hydrothermal reservoirs. With a time lag of 5 months to monthly mean QB values in Lake Kuttara, the correlation with monthly mean HGin in Okunoyu was significant (R2 = 0.586; p \&lt; 0.01). Applying Darcy\&rsquo;s law to the leakage from the hydrothermal reservoir at 260\&ndash;310 m below the lake bottom, the time needed for groundwater\&rsquo;s passage through the media 260\&ndash;310 m thick was evaluated at 148\&ndash;149 days (ca. 5 months). These findings suggest that the hydrothermal reservoir below lake bottom and the underlying hydrothermal reservoirs in the western geothermal area are both connected to a unique geothermal source in the deeper zone as a geothermal flow system of Kuttara Volcano.},

  abstract = {A dangerous block-ash eruption occurred without warning from Ruapehu Crater Lake on 25 September 2007, ending a 6month period of temperature decline in the lake. The northerly-directed blast sent ballistics of up to 2m diameter more than 2km from the source. The ejecta comprised a variety of volcano-lacustrine lithologies, many showing evidence of intense hydrothermal alteration. Petrographic studies of the ballistics reveal numerous examples of pores/vesicles being filled with assemblages of elemental sulphur, anhydrite, pyrite and natroalunite, and many ballistics exuded liquid sulphur from their pores during cooling at atmospheric pressure. Up to 5\% of the ash was comprised of fine-grained, juvenile glass material, confirming the presence of magma in the shallow vent environment. A long-recognised characteristic of this volcano is the thermal cycling behaviour of the Crater Lake, behaviour which has remained effectively unchanged through two magmatic eruption events in 1945 and in 1995/96. Airborne measurements of CO2 and SO2 flux from the volcano since 2003 show a strong, positive correspondence with temperature cycling in the lake, pointing to a definitive link between heat and mass discharge through the system. Low SO2 emission rates and C/S mole ratios {$>$}30 were typical of the period 2003 to early 2007, and appear to reflect vigorous scrubbing of S gases in the hydrothermal system during this time. To better understand the chemical and physical processes operating in this very dynamic volcanic-hydrothermal system, and its propensity to develop potentially dangerous hydrothermal seals, we have developed an integrated finite-difference (TOUGH2) heat–mass transport simulation of the hydrothermal environment. The model, which is constrained by observed heat and mass flux characteristics of the volcano, demonstrates the transient nature of the heating cycles on the vent/lake system. Of particular interest is the role of CO2 as a relatively inert, pressure-transmitting medium in the hydrothermal environment. Seal formation was simulated using the reactive transport code X1t, which showed that condensation of magmatic vapour into a highly porous medium of andesitic composition leads to rapid formation of an elemental sulphur–anhydrite–natroalunite mineral assemblage, and a drastic reduction in permeability. We suggest that since the 1995/96 vent-clearing eruptions, a shroud of elemental sulphur and other alteration phases formed along the margins of the 2-phase liquid–vapour region enclosing the conduit. This effectively seals the upper portion of the vent from the adjacent, hydrostatically controlled environment, and allows for development of pressurised, vapour-static gas columns beneath the northern and central vents.},

In addition to those equations, fluid velocity is classically given by the Darcy law. Thermodynamic properties are given by a set of equations from the IAPWS-IF97 thermodynamic formulation. This system is solved with pressure and enthalpy as the primary variables to increase stability of phase transition between single and two-phase states. We have chosen to use a splitting method to get rid of the complexity of coupling equations and a finite volume method for the spatial discretization.

Kalman filters estimate the weights of a neural network, considering the weights as a dynamic and upgradable system. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a tool that has been used by many authors for the training of Neural Networks (NN) over the years. However, this filter has some inherent drawbacks such as instability caused by initial conditions due to linearization and costly calculation of the Jacobian matrices. Therefore, the Unscented Kalman Filter variant has been demonstrated by several authors to be superior in terms of convergence, speed and accuracy when compared to the EKF. Training using this algorithm tends to become more precise compared to EKF, due to its linear transformation technique known as the Unscented Transform (UT). The results presented in this study validate the efficiency and accuracy of the Kalman filter variants reported by other authors, with superior performance in non-linear systems when compared with traditional methods. Such approaches are still little explored in the literature.},

  abstract = {Many active volcanoes in the world exhibit Strombolian activity, which is typically characterized by relatively frequent mild events and also by rare and much more destructive major explosions and paroxysms. Detailed analyses of past major and minor events can help to understand the eruptive behavior of the volcano and the underlying physical and chemical processes. Catalogs of volcanic eruptions may be established using continuous seismic recordings at stations in the proximity of volcanoes. However, in many cases, the analysis of the recordings relies heavily on the manual picking of events by human experts. Recently developed Machine Learning-based approaches require large training data sets which may not be available a priori. Here, we propose an alternative automated approach: the Adaptive-Window Volcanic Event Selection Analysis Module (AWESAM). This process of creating event catalogs consists of three main steps: (i) identification of potential volcanic events based on squared ground-velocity amplitudes, an adaptive MaxFilter, and a prominence threshold. (ii) catalog consolidation by comparing and verification of the initial detections based on recordings from two different seismic stations. (iii) identification and exclusion of signals from regional tectonic earthquakes. The software package is applied to publicly accessible continuous seismic recordings from two almost equidistant stations at Stromboli volcano in Italy. We tested AWESAM by comparison with a hand-picked catalog and found that around 95 \% of the eruptions with a signal-to-noise ratio above three are detected. In a first application, we derive a new amplitude-frequency relationship from over 290.000 volcanic events at Stromboli during 2019-2020. The module allows for a straightforward generalization and application to other volcanoes worldwide.},

This stability is punctuated by occasional crises involving rapid filling and draining of the lake and changes in water temperature. The most recent such crisis occurred in December 2004 to April 2005. Using the results of previous theoretical and experimental work on analogue models, we present a combined thermal, hydrological, and fluid mechanical model of the Boiling Lake. This reveals that the lake appears to be suspended above the local water table by a constant supply of rising steam bubbles sourced from the boiling of groundwater near an igneous intrusion. The bubbles condense in the Boiling Lake, maintaining the temperature at ?90?C. The geometry of the lake- conduit system provides a mechanism for instability, with a denser liquid lake overlying a bubbly fractured permeable conduit. Following a sufficiently large perturbation, the whole lake rapidly drains until the surface is at the local water table level. The persistent gas supply then reinitiates filling. We propose that local seismic activity may have caused shock nucleation of bubbles within the conduit and triggered the instability of the Boiling Lake.},

Inferno Crater Lake, in the Waimangu Geothermal area near Rotorua, has regular cycles in its temperature and lake level, varying from 12 to 56 days in length. These cycles do not seem to be related to the magmatic activity of Okataina Volcanic Center, rather representing an unstable heat convection system under the lake. The cycling patterns show four different types of cycle, based on sixty-five years of data. Each kind of cycle has a specific behavior of lake temperature and water level. Type II is the most common cycle with a mean length of 33.2 days and one overflow. When successive overflows happen, we have a cycle of type I, with an average length of 56.1 days. The lack of overflow defines the other two types; type III for short cycles lasting about 12.0 days, or a type IV whose mean length is 30.0 days. Even if types I to III show some tendency to repeat, no features of the cycle can be used to predict which type will occur next. All the types of cycle start with the same rapid rise of lake temperature and level. Heavy rainfall and seismic and hydrothermal events do not generate any particular type of cycle. Finally, the regular oscillations which occur during a cycle with an average period of 2.2 days could be generated by accumulating steam pressure in a volume under the lake, similar to a geyser mechanism.},

Here we show through a statistical analysis of satellite-based long-wavelength (10.780–11.280 μm) infrared data that the last magmatic and phreatic eruptions of five different volcanoes were preceded by subtle but significant long-term (years), large-scale (tens of square kilometres) increases in their radiant heat flux (up to \textasciitilde 1 °C in median radiant temperature). Large-scale thermal unrest is detected even before eruptions that were not anticipated from other volcano monitoring methods, such as the 2014 phreatic eruption of Ontake (Japan) and the 2015 magmatic eruption of Calbuco (Chile). We attribute large-scale thermal unrest to the enhancement of underground hydrothermal activity, and suggest that such analysis of satellite-based infrared observations can improve constraints on the thermal budget of volcanoes, early detection of pre-eruptive conditions and assessments of volcanic alert levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {The surface energy balance (SEB) of a freshwater body must incorporate shortwave (solar) and long-wave (terrestrial) radiation, together with evaporation and sensible heat energy fluxes. For inclusion in a prognostic water quality model it is vital to be able to calculate, rather than measure, these energy terms and to relate them to routinely observed meteorological parameters such as air temperature and cloud cover. Here various formulae are analyzed and compared by using two climatologically different data bases. For shortwave radiation the formulae recommended for use, in the dearth of local observations, are those of Prescott (1940) (for temporal scales of weeks or months) and Tucker (1982) (for shorter time scales). The shortwave albedo can be given by the parametrization of Pivovarov (1972), the incoming long-wave atmospheric radiation by a blackbody representation modified by an effective atmospheric emissivity (Raphael, 1962), and the evaporative flux by the equation of Sill (1983), with the sensible heat flux being related to the evaporative energy flux via the Bowen ratio under conditions of neutral atmospheric stability.},

We introduce a stochastic dynamical system in which the parameter-to-data map is embedded, with the goal of employing techniques from nonlinear Kalman filtering to estimate the parameter given the data. The extended Kalman filter (which we refer to as ExKI in the context of inverse problems) can be effective for some inverse problems approached this way, but is impractical when the forward map is not readily differentiable and is given as a black box, and also for high dimensional parameter spaces because of the need to propagate large covariance matrices. Application of ensemble Kalman filters, for example use of the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithm, has emerged as a useful tool which overcomes both of these issues: it is derivative free and works with a low-rank covariance approximation formed from the ensemble. In this paper, we work with the ExKI, EKI, and a variant on EKI which we term unscented Kalman inversion (UKI).},

  abstract = {Bathymetric observations of Ruapehu Crater Lake show that it became shallower and its volume decreased by 3 × 106 m3 between 1965 and 1970. It is likely that this was due to lava moving upwards in the region under the lake. From the regular measurements of Crater Lake temperature, outflow, and chloride and magnesium ion concentrations, the inflows of steam, cold water and chloride and magnesium ions were calculated, using the 1970 volume. Only about half the precipitation falling on and around the lake mixes with the lake water, since the cold fresh water floats on top of the denser lake water, and travels to the outlet without mixing with the main body of water in the lake. The chloride content of the input steam appears to vary with time, in a similar fashion to that of White Island fumaroles. Temperature and density profiles of the lake in 1965 and 1966 indicated that convection was occurring. The temperature profile of the top 175 m of the lake agreed with a model of turbulent convection in small cells, giving a temperature gradient at any level in the lake proportional to the heat flux at that level. The convection model predicted that the temperature at depth would exceed the local boiling point if the thermal power input reached a value which would sustain a surface temperature approaching 60°C. This prediction of instability was not inconsistent with observations. Convection in the present Crater Lake probably occurs in the form of thermal plumes from small sources. © 1981.},

  abstract = {Regular observations of temperature, outflow rates and water chemistry of Crater Lake, Mt. Ruapehu, New Zealand have been made for the last 25 years. These data have been used to derive a model of the dynamics of the lake, and determine the input of energy, mass, and chloride from the volcano to the Crater Lake. The recent, relatively quiescent state of the volcano, when virtually no heat has been input to the lake, has also enabled an assessment to be made of the surface heat loss characteristics, which play an important role in the model of the lake. The modelling suggests that since about 1982 the ratio of the volcanic heat to mass added to the base of the lake is about 6 MJ/kg, which is not compatible with heating of the lake by magmatic steam alone. Thus, only about 50\% of the heating has been by magmatic steam. It is suggested that heat could be transferred from a magmatic source to the region below the lake by a heat-pipe mechanism, commonly associated with geothermal systems. The simultaneous upward movement of vapour phase, and downward movement of liquid phase from condensed vapour allows efficient heat transfer without overall mass transfer. The permeability necessary to supply the required heat is of the order of 10 darcy, and is consistent with a rubble filled vent. For at least the last five years, there has been a characteristic pattern in the Crater Lake temperature record, with alternate heating and cooling phases. The heating phase generally lasts for one or two months, while the cooling phase lasts for six months to a year. A possible explanation for this cyclic behaviour is the presence of a layer of liquid sulphur under Crater Lake, acting as a partial barrier between the heat-pipe and the lake. The unusual variations of the viscosity of liquid sulphur with temperature will mean that at temperatures greater than 160°C, the layer of sulphur becomes highly viscous and would block any upwards steam flow and hence stop the heat input to Crater Lake, so producing a cooling phase. This blockage would last until the heating from below raised the temperature of the sulphur beyond the high-viscosity region, so gases could again pass through the sulphur. © 1991.},

This supported the use of evaporation equations that allowed for the changing air conditions as incoming air became warmer and wetter from interaction with the lake, so decreasing the overall evaporation rate.

Thus, quantitative analysis of these systems depends mainly on numerical solution of coupled partial differential equations and complementary equations of state (EOS). The past 2 decades have seen steady growth of computational power and the development of numerical models that have eliminated or minimized the need for various simplifying assumptions. Considerable heuristic insight has been gained from process-oriented numerical modeling. Recent modeling efforts employing relatively complete EOS and accurate transport calculations have revealed dynamic behavior that was damped by linearized, less accurate models, including fluid property control of hydrothermal plume temperatures and three-dimensional geometries. Other recent modeling results have further elucidated the controlling role of permeability structure and revealed the potential for significant hydrothermally driven deformation. Key areas for future research include incorporation of accurate EOS for the complete H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, more realistic treatment of material heterogeneity in space and time, realistic description of large-scale relative permeability behavior, and intercode benchmarking comparisons.},

  institution = {{Oregon Health \& Science University}},
  abstract = {Probabilistic inference is the problem of estimating the hidden variables (states or parameters) of a system in an optimal and consistent fashion as a set of noisy or incomplete observations of the system becomes available online. The optimal solution to this problem is given by the recursive Bayesian estimation algorithm which recursively updates the posterior density of the system state as new observations arrive. This posterior density constitutes the complete solution to the probabilistic inference problem, and allows us to calculate any "optimal" estimate of the state. Unfortunately, for most real-world problems, the optimal Bayesian recursion is intractable and approximate solutions must be used. Within the space of approximate solutions, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become one of the most widely used algorithms with applications in state, parameter and dual estimation. Unfortunately, the EKF is based on a sub-optimal implementation of the recursive Bayesian estimation framework applied to Gaussian random variables. This can seriously affect the accuracy or even lead to divergence of any inference system that is based on the EKF or that uses the EKF as a component part. Recently a number of related novel, more accurate and theoretically better motivated algorithmic alternatives to the EKF have surfaced in the literature, with specific application to state estimation for automatic control. We have extended these algorithms, all based on derivativeless deterministic sampling based approximations of the relevant Gaussian statistics, to a family of algorithms called Sigma-Point Kalman Filters (SPKF). Furthermore, we successfully expanded the use of this group of algorithms (SPKFs) within the general field of probabilistic inference and machine learning, both as stand-alone filters and as subcomponents of more powerful sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters). We have consistently shown that there are large performance benefits to be gained by applying Sigma-Point Kalman filters to areas where EKFs have been used as the de facto standard in the past, as well as in new areas where the use of the EKF is impossible.},

  abstract = {Volcanic lakes have a wide range of characteristics, and we make an attempt to delineate the limiting physical conditions for several lake classes. The ratio between heat input and heat dissipation capacity of a lake constrains the temperature for perfectly mixed steady-state volcanic lakes. Poorly mixed lakes are also conditioned by this ratio, but their temperature structure is also strongly influenced by the hydrodynamics resulting from different mechanisms of heat transfer. The steady-state temperatures of volcanic lakes are largely determined by the magnitude of the volcanic heat influx relative to the surface area of the lake. Small lakes have only a small capacity for heat dissipation and their temperature rises quickly with only small heat inputs; large lakes are buffered against variations in heat input. Both the heat dissipation and meteoric water input into a lake are functions of lake surface area and therefore each lake water temperature demands a certain precipitation rate for mass conservation, independent of lake size. The results of energy/mass-balance modeling shows that under common atmospheric conditions, most steady-state volcanic lakes are unlikely to maintain a temperature in excess of 45–50{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu$}°C. Validation of the volcanic lake model was performed using published data from Yugama Lake (Japan) and the Keli Mutu lakes (Indonesia). Also, the model was applied to 24 natural systems to provide a baseline assessment of energy fluxes under the model assumptions so future work on those systems can identify nuances in individual systems that deviate from the simple model conditions. We recommend the model for use in assessing temperature variations and volcanic lake stability in settings with known physical and atmospheric conditions. Application of the energy/mass balance calculations of model lakes provides a genetic classification scheme largely based on physical process parameters.},

  abstract = {Geothermal systems are an important resource in the global effort to reduce fossil fuel use. They are formed by convection of water heated at depth, but without external controls convection is unstable and upflows move or dissipate. In the central Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand, the geothermal systems have been in the same locations for more than 50 kyr. We created heat and fluid flow models with uniform geology and basal heat which showed that the known topography localizes convective upflows. Fourteen out of 19 known geothermal systems in the model area were correctly located beneath topographic lows. Even at 3 km depth, inclusion of topography in our models improved agreement between the locations of upflows and low-resistivity zones derived from 3-D inversion of magnetotelluric data. Therefore, while topography is not the only factor that influences geothermal convection, its contribution is on a larger scale than is generally assumed.},

  abstract = {Large-scale landslide prediction is typically based on numerical modeling, with computer codes generally involving a large number of input parameters. Addressing the influence of each of them on the final result and providing a ranking procedure may be useful for risk management purposes. This can be performed by a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, such an analysis requires a large number of computer code simulations, which appears impracticable for computationally demanding simulations, with computation times ranging from several hours to several days. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a “meta-model”-based strategy consisting in replacing the complex simulator by a “statistical approximation” provided by a Gaussian-process (GP) model. This allows computation of sensitivity measures from a limited number of simulations. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is used to rank in terms of importance the properties of the elastoplastic model describing the complex behavior of the slip surface in the La Frasse landslide (Switzerland). One limitation of the GP-based methodology is that the computation of sensitivity measures is associated with uncertainty as the simulator is approximated using a training sample of small size, i.e., a limited knowledge on the “true” simulator. This source of uncertainty can be taken into account by treating the GP model from a Bayesian perspective. This provides the full posterior probability distribution associated with the sensitivity measures, which can be summarized by a confidence interval to outline the regions where the GP model is “unsure.” We show that this methodology is able to provide useful guidelines for the practical decision-making process and suggest further site investigations.},

The main non-meteoric source of water and Cl for the lake is a boiling spring (Soap Pool) discharging saline and neutral water with a variable flow rate from 0 to 30 kg/s inside the El Chichón crater. Variations in lake volume over time were approximately determined from digitized photographic views of the lake using an empirical relationship between depth of the lake and surface area, obtained after four bathymetric surveys. The best correlation between the observed changes in lake volume, Cl content and the measured flow rate of Soap Pool was obtained by a box-model for the Cl mass balance. Based on a trend in the Cl content of the Soap Pool water a model of a “buried” initial crater lake is proposed.},

  abstract = {El Chichón volcano (Chiapas, Mexico) erupted violently in March–April 1982, breaching through the former volcano–hydrothermal system. Since then, the 1982 crater has hosted a shallow (1–3.3~m, acidic (pH ∼ 2.2) and warm (∼ 30~°C) crater lake with a strongly varying chemistry (Cl/SO4=0–79 molar ratio). The changes in crater lake chemistry and volume are not systematically related to the seasonal variation of rainfall, but rather to the activity of near-neutral geyser-like springs in the crater (Soap Pool). These Soap Pool springs are the only sources of Cl for the lake. Their geyser-like behaviour with a long-term (months to years) periodicity is due to a specific geometry of the shallow boiling aquifer beneath the lake, which is the remnant of the 1983 Cl-rich (24,000~mg/l) crater lake water. The Soap Pool springs decreased in Cl content over time. The zero-time extrapolation (1982, year of the eruption) approaches the Cl content in the initial crater lake, meanwhile the extrapolation towards the future indicates a zero-Cl content by 2009±1. This particular situation offers the opportunity to calculate mass balance and Cl budget to quantify the lake–spring system in the El Chichón crater. These calculations show that the water balance without the input of SP springs is negative, implying that the lake should disappear during the dry season. The isotopic composition of lake waters (δD and δ18O) coincide with this crater lake-SP dynamics, reflecting evaporation processes and mixing with SP geyser and meteoric water. Future dome growth, not observed yet in the post-1982 El Chichón crater, may be anticipated by changes in lake chemistry and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Seismic and geochemical data collected at Poás volcano, Costa Rica, since 1978 suggest that temperature and chemical variations recorded in subaerial fumaroles and the crater lake are related to episodic release of heat and volatiles associated with hydrofracturing of the upper margin of the shallow magma body. Power outputs associated with these events approach 600 MW and are superimposed on a baseline energy flux of approximately 200 MW. The baseline heat flux suggests a magma solidification rate of 0.012 km3/yr and background volatile release rates of 1000 t/d H2O, 66 t/d, S, 13 t/d Cl, and 0.5 t/d F. These fluxes are comparable to fluxes of F, Cl and S exiting the magmatic/hydrothermal system through acidic flank springs and are about a factor of five less than estimated volatile fluxes through summit fumaroles during the high-temperature event of 1981–1983. Mass balance considerations suggest that heat released at the lake surface is primarily supplied by the ascent of heated brines supplemented by condensation of fumarolic steam. Calculated average seepage rates out of the lake (≈ 450 kg/s) indicate rapid convection of acidic lake brine through underlying lake sediments and pyroclastic deposits. Circulation of the extremely corrosive lake brine through the volcanoelastic material beneath the lake may enhance subsurface permeabilities. Fluxes of rock-forming elements observed in the Rio Agrio basin on the northwest flank of Poás suggest that dissolution and removal of volcano-elastic material occurs at a rate of approximately 1650 m3/yr. However, estimated sulfur fluxes from the cooling magma body suggest that porosity created by this dissolution could quickly be filled by the deposition of native sulfur. Finally,analysis of heat and water budgets for the crater lake over the period 1978–1989 indicates that the recent decline and disappearance of the lake was caused by variations in summit rainfall combined with an increase in subsurface heat flow to the lake in 1987–1988. The increase in heat flow is related to continued degassing of high-temperature volatiles following a hydrofracturing/magma ascent episode that occurred in 1986.},

  abstract = {Frying Pan and Inferno Crater lakes occupy craters formed on 10 June 1886 during the Tarawera Rift eruption. These lakes are the largest and most spectacular hot springs in New Zealand, and together they display interrelated cyclic variations about a 38 day cycle. The lake occupying Inferno Crater fluctuates from overflow to about 8 m below overflow, although exceptionally the water level has receded below 12 m, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than other known geyser like hot springs. The temperature fluctuates sympathetically with the water level in the range 35.0 to 84.5°C. Four distinct stages are recognised with the following average parameters; the first lasts 7.7 days, water level and temperature rise respectively 4.7m and 17.3°C, while the lake volume increases by 23 800 m3. The second lasts 14.7 days, water level rises 3.99 m, the temperature remains steady about 60.7°C, lake volume increases 22 000 m3. The third is an overflow of 79.1 litre sec-1 for 51.3 hours peaking at 70.6°C. In the fourth stage, lake level recedes 7.9m decreasing lake volume 45 800 m3 over 15.1 days, and the lake temperature falls 26.4°C. The discharge of nearby Frying Pan Lake varies inversely with the water level of Inferno Crater Lake by 20.2 ± 2.7 litre sec-1 and also responds to a previously unrecognised cycle of about 20 days duration. The temperature of the discharge also responds to the 20 and 38 day cycles, but shows no correlation with discharge volume. Ambient air temperature strongly influences the discharge temperature, which ranges annually between 44.3°C and 56.6°C with a mean of 50.1°C. A slight decrease of about 1.4°C is apparent between 1972 and 1990. The mean annual discharge from Frying Pan Lake has decreased from 122.2 to 104.1 litre sec-1 between 1972 and 1990. © 1995.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution Digital Surface Model and a commercial digital camera have enabled precise and continuous monitoring of the crater lake at Aso volcano. From July 2006 onwards, infrared (IR) thermometry has been used with this system, enabling more accurate measurements of lake volume and temperature based on simple and intensive observations than has been possible in any other previous studies. The heat discharge remained largely constant at approximately 220 MW, with the exception of an abrupt increase to 280 MW that coincided with a rapid decrease in the water level in August 2007. Simultaneously, an increase in temperature at a shallow depth was suggested by other observations. The crater lake was found to respond to even slight changes in volcanic fluid supply, which can be well quantified by our method. Thus, a crater lake can be monitored more precisely than subaerial fumaroles whose energy estimation is often accompanied by large uncertainties. Our monitoring technique of a crater lake provides information on the subsurface hydrothermal system beneath it, for which any in-situ measurements are practically impossible.},

  abstract = {The first crater of Nakadake, peak of Aso volcano, Japan, contains a hot water lake that shows interesting variations in water level and temperature. These variations were discovered by precise, continuous observations of the lake independent of precipitation. We developed a numerical model of a hot crater lake and compared with observational data for the period from July 2006 to January 2009. The numerical model revealed seasonal changes in mass flux (75–132~kg/s) and enthalpy (1,840–3,030~kJ/kg) for the fluid supplied to the lake. The relation between the enthalpy and mass flux indicates that the bottom input fluid is a mixture of high- and low-temperature fluids. Assuming a mixture of high-temperature steam at 800°C and liquid water at 100°C, we evaluated the liquid and steam fluxes. The liquid water flux shows a seasonal increase lagging behind the rainy season by 2~months, suggesting that the liquid water is predominantly groundwater. The fluctuation pattern in the flux of the high-temperature steam shows a relation with the amplitude of volcanic tremor, suggesting that heating of the hydrothermal system drives the tremor. Consequently, precise observations of a hot crater lake represent a potential method of monitoring volcanic hydrothermal systems in the shallow parts of the volcanoes.},

  abstract = {We carried out analogue experiments on two-phase boiling systems, using a porous vertical cylinder, saturated with water. The base of the cylinder was heated, and the top was cooled, as in a natural hydrothermal system. Previous work had shown that once the two-phase zone reached a certain level, thermal instabilities would develop. We made measurements of the acoustic energy related to boiling, and we found that high levels of acoustic noise were associated with the part of the cycle in which there was upward water movement. We repeated our experiments with a cooling water tank at the top of the system, representing a crater lake. This showed that periodic thermal instabilities still developed in this situation. We then compared our analogue measurements to two natural systems known to exhibit periodic behavior. There is good agreement between the thermal and acoustic cycling seen in our model and the observations made at Inferno Crater Lake in the Waimangu Geothermal area, New Zealand, whose level cycles by nearly 10 m, with a typical period of 38 days. Particularly notable is how in both systems high levels of acoustic noise are associated with rising water level. The much larger Ruapehu Crater Lake, also in New Zealand, cycled with a period of several months to a year for over a decade prior to the 1995 eruption. Strong acoustic and seismic energy usually occurred just before the lake temperature started to rise. This suggests a slightly different model, in which the increasing two-phase flow zone triggers more general convection once it reaches the base of the lake.},

  abstract = {The lake level and temperature of Inferno Crater Lake, a hot lake in the Waimangu Geothermal Field, vary in quasiregular cycles with a period of about 30 to 50 days. Between 1970 and 1991, several hydrothermal eruptions at other sites within the Waimangu system affected this cycling, especially the cycle period. This indicated that although the cycling was most evident in one small lake, it was sensitive to any changes in the surrounding geothermal system. After the Raupo Pond eruption, which produced the largest effects, the recovery of the temperature and cycle period was consistent with extra energy diffusing out of the previously proposed heat pipe system. The 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake, whose hypocenter was 50 km from Waimangu, also seems to have significantly affected the hydrothermal system, reducing the cycle period for at least a year afterwards.},

  abstract = {The problem involves turbulent diffusion of momentum, sensible heat, and water vapor in the lower atmosphere when a neutral, dry air mass encounters a warm, wet surface. The water surface temperature is specified, and the surface roughness is taken to be constant over land and water. The turbulent fluxes are formulated by a semiempirical turbulence theory with the Businger-Dyer form of the Monin-Obukhov similarity functions, a water vapor buoyancy term in the Obukhov stability length, and Blackadar's scaling height in the mixing length. The resulting solution of the equations of conservation shows that the stability discontinuity at the leading edge can greatly affect the mean rate of evaporation and that the vertical vapor flux can greatly contribute to the atmospheric stability. The solution is relatively insensitive to the exact form of the Monin-Obukhov similarity functions or to the exactness of Reynolds' analogy or von Karman's constant. For large fetches and near-neutral conditions the solution becomes similar to that obtained in Sutton's problem and with Harbeck's empirical formula.},

The tool, named pestpp-ies, implements the ensemble-smoother form of the popular Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, uses the pest model-interface protocols and includes a built-in parallel run manager, multiple lambda testing and model run failure tolerance. As a demonstration of its capabilities, pestpp-ies is applied to a synthetic groundwater model with thousands of parameters and to a real-world groundwater flow and transport model with tens of thousands of parameters. pestpp-ies is shown to efficiently and effectively condition parameters in both cases and can provide means to estimate posterior forecast uncertainty when the forecasts depend on large numbers of parameters.},

  abstract = {Eleven equations for calculating evaporation were compared with evaporation determined by the energy budget method for Williams Lake, Minnesota. Data were obtained from instruments on a raft, on land near the lake, and at a weather station 60 km south of the lake. The comparisons were based on monthly values for the open-water periods of 5 years, a total of 22 months. A modified DeBruin-Keijman, Priestley-Taylor, and a modified Penman equation resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed most closely with energy budget values. To use these equations, net radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity need to be measured near the lake. In addition, thermal surveys need to be made to determine change in heat stored in the lake. If data from distant climate stations are the only data available, and they include solar radiation, the Jensen-Haise and Makkink equations resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed reasonably well with energy budget values.},

  abstract = {Swimming pools as thermal sinks for air conditioners could save approximately 40\% on peak cooling power and 30\% of overall cooling energy, compared to standard residential air conditioning. Heat dissipation from pools in semi-arid climates with large diurnal temperature shifts is such that pool heating and space cooling may occur concurrently; in which case heat rejected from cooling equipment could directly displace pool heating energy, while also improving space cooling efficiency. The performance of such a system relies on the natural temperature regulation of swimming pools governed by evaporative and convective heat exchange with the air, radiative heat exchange with the sky, and conductive heat exchange with the ground. This paper describes and validates a model that uses meteorological data to accurately predict the hourly temperature of a swimming pool to within 1.1~°C maximum error over the period of observation. A thorough review of literature guided our choice of the most appropriate set of equations to describe the natural mass and energy exchange between a swimming pool and the environment. Monitoring of a pool in Davis, CA, was used to confirm the resulting simulations. Comparison of predicted and observed pool temperature for all hours over a 56 day experimental period shows an R-squared relatedness of 0.967.},
