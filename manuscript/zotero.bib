The re searchers operationalized the model, subjected items to iterative rounds of content analysis, and administered the finalized questionnaire to inter- national ESL (English as a second language) students in Malaysian and Australian universities.

  abstract = {Rocky coasts are attacked by waves that drive sea-cliff retreat and etch promontories and embayments into the coastline. Understanding the evolution of such coastlines requires knowledge of the energy supplied by waves, which should depend upon both the deep-water waves and the coastal bathymetry they cross. We employ microseismic measurements of the wave-induced shaking of sea cliffs near Santa Cruz, California, as a proxy for the temporal pattern of wave-energy delivery to the coast during much of the winter 2001 storm season. Visual inspection of the time series suggests that both deep-water wave heights and tide levels exert considerable control on the energy delivered. We test this concept quantitatively with two models in which synthetic time series of wave power at the coast are compared with the shaking data. In the first model, deep-water wave power is linearly scaled by a fitting parameter; because this model fails to account for the strong tidal signal, it fits poorly. In the second model, the wave transformation associated with shoaling and refraction diminishes the nearshore wave power, and dissipation associated with bottom drag and wave breaking is parameterized by exponential dependencies on two length scales; this model reduces the variance by 32\{percnt\}-45\{percnt\} and captures the essence of the full signal. Shoaling and refraction greatly modulate the wave power delivered to the coast. Energy dissipated by bottom drag across the shelf is relatively small; the dissipation length scale is many times the path length across the shelf. In contrast, much energy is dissipated in the surf zone; the tidal-dissipation depth scale is of the same order as the tidal range (1-2 m), which accounts for the strong dependence of the cliff shaking on the tide.},

The data reveal the presence of a hitherto unsuspected, areally extensive, Jurassic part of the Torlesse composite terrane in the Kaimanawa, Kaweka, and Ruahine Ranges, which we name the Kaweka Terrane. Kaweka rocks have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (at metamorphism) and detrital zircon patterns that in part are transitional between Rakaia and Pahau Terrane rocks and in part similar to Waipapa Terrane rocks. Combined detrital zircon age data for all Torlesse and Waipapa Terrane data reveal an essential unity, with a long persistence (260120 Ma) of predominant Permian-Triassic sources in the form of a major Cordilleran-style batholith, a decline in major early Paleozoic-Precambrian sources between 260 and 220 Ma, and presence of minor Early Carboniferous to Late Devonian sources between 180 and 120 Ma.

  abstract = {Recent measurements at the National Geothermal Test Facility at East Mesa, California, and the Savannah River Plant, South Carolina, have spurred a renewed look at evaporation from heated water bodies. Theoretical analyses are provided for each of four evaporation regimes that could be experienced at heated ponds, ranging from free convective layers to forced convective layers. Differences among regimes are highlighted by calculations appropriate for the Savannah River site where water temperatures reach 70\textdegree C and underscore the difficulty in finding a single evaporation equation to adequately cover the entire range. Consequently, a new equation is developed which combines free and forced convection in a different manner from previous equations: evaporation is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the respective components. The new equation and several existing equations are compared with evaporation measured at water bodies at the Savannah River and the East Mesa sites.},

  abstract = {Since its debut by John Skilling in 2004, nested sampling has proven a valuable tool to the scientist, providing hypothesis evidence calculations and parameter inference for complicated posterior distributions, particularly in the field of astronomy. Due to its computational complexity and long-running nature, in the past, nested sampling has been reserved for offline-type Bayesian inference, leaving tools such as variational inference and MCMC for online-type, time-constrained, Bayesian computations. These tools do not easily handle complicated multi-modal posteriors, discrete random variables, and posteriors lacking gradients, nor do they enable practical calculations of the Bayesian evidence. An opening thus remains for a high-performance out-of-the-box nested sampling package that can close the gap in computational time, and let nested sampling become common place in the data science toolbox. We present JAX-based nested sampling (JAXNS), a high-performance nested sampling package written in XLA-primitives using JAX, and show that it is several orders of magnitude faster than the currently available nested sampling implementations of PolyChord, MultiNEST, and dynesty, while maintaining the same accuracy of evidence calculation. The JAXNS package is publically available at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/joshuaalbert/jaxns\}.},

  abstract = {Automatic phase-picking algorithms are designed to detect a seismic signal on a single trace and to time the arrival of the signal precisely. Because of the requirement for precise timing, a phase-picking algorithm is inherently less sensitive than one designed only to detect the presence of a signal, but still can approach the performance of a skilled analyst. A typical algorithm filters the input data and then generates a function characterizing the seismic time series. This function may be as simple as the absolute value of the series, or it may be quite complex. Event detection is accomplished by comparing the function or its short-term average (STA) with a threshold value (THR), which is commonly some multiple of a long-term average (LTA) of a characteristic function. If the STA exceeds THR, a trigger is declared. If the event passes simple criteria, it is reported. Sensitivity, expected timing error, false-trigger rate, and false-report rate are interrelated measures of performance controlled by choice of the characteristic function and several operating parameters. At present, computational power limits most systems to one-pass, time-domain algorithms. Rapidly advancing semi-conductor technology, however, will make possible much more powerful multi-pass approaches incorporating frequency-domain detection and pseudo-offline timing.},

  abstract = {Mt. Egmont/Taranaki in western North Island, New Zealand, has been inactive during historic time and thus its pattern of eruptive history must be reconstructed by inference from the stratigraphy and chronology of associated volcanic and pyroclastic deposits. The most complete record of eruptive activity from Egmont Volcano is found on the surrounding ring plain rather than on the volcanic cone, where surficial deposits are readily removed by erosion or deeply buried by the products of more recent eruptions. In this study, a comprehensive post-28 ka record of the volcano's eruptive history is presented, and the relationship of andesitic tephra beds to andic soil material, Egmont-sourced volcaniclastic detritus, and two silicic tephra beds from Taupo Volcano are discussed, along with implications for inter-regional correlation. The post-28 ka tephra succession is recorded in sixteen andesitic tephra formations. These formations and their approximate ages are as follows: Manganui tephra (4 beds; c. 3.1 ka), Inglewood Tephra (2 beds; c. 3.6 ka), Korito Tephra (2 beds; c. 4.1 ka), Mangatoki Tephra (2 beds; c. 4.4 ka), Tariki Tephra (6 beds; c. 4.6\textendash 4.7 ka), Waipuku Tephra (1 bed; c. 5.2 ka), Kaponga Tephra (10 beds; c. 8.0\textendash 10.0 ka), Konini Tephra (2 beds; c. 10.1 ka), Mahoe Tephra (4 beds; c. 11.0\textendash 11.4 ka), Kaihouri tephra (8 beds; c. 12.9\textendash 18.8 ka), Paetahi Tephra (6 beds; c. 19.4\textendash 20.2 ka), Poto Tephra (15 beds; c. 20.9\textendash 22.7 ka), Tuikonga Tephra (4 beds; c. 23.4\textendash 24.0 ka), Koru Tephra (2 beds; c. 24.8\textendash 25.2 ka), Pukeiti Tephra (1 bed; c. 26.2 ka) and Waitepuke Tephra (3 beds; c. 27.5\textendash 28.0 ka). Many of these tephra beds are sufficiently distinct and widespread enough to permit the dating and correlation of ring-plain forming volcaniclastic deposits with which they are interbedded. The post-28 ka tephra succession can also be subdivided into three broad sequences on the basis of major variations in the morphological and mineralogical characteristics of inter-bedded andic soil material. At least 76 tephra events from Egmont Volcano with volumes exceeding 107 m3 have been recorded since c. 28 ka with an average eruptive periodicity of one in every c. 330 years. This frequency is considered minimal since more tephras of lesser magnitude may have been erupted but are only represented on the ring plain as intermittent accretion of fine-grained ash that has rapidly weathered to andic soil material.},

  abstract = {We have found experimental evidence which shows that the volcanic tremor recorded at Deception Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) is a superposition in time of overlapping hybrid events. We studied data from a small aperture seismic array. Data analysis for tremor and hybrids included: (1) spectral analysis; (2) apparent slowness and back-azimuth determination by using the zero-lag cross-correlation method; and (3) polarization analysis. Both types of events share these common features: (a) two dominant spectral bands at frequencies 1\textendash 3 Hz (the most energetic) and 4\textendash 8 Hz; (b) several coherent phases with the same back-azimuth to the source and apparent slowness along the whole signal; (c) in the high frequency band, the apparent slowness is very low (around 0.17 s/km), indicating the propagation of body waves; (d) in the low frequency band, the apparent slowness is high (around 1.6 s/km), consistent with the presence of surface waves; and (e) clear P-wave onset followed by a complex pattern of Rayleigh waves. Therefore, both types of events are strongly related because they share the same source region, the same wave-propagation properties, and the same wave composition. Moreover, several arrivals, that resemble a single hybrid event, have been found along the tremor signals. Due to these reasons, we hypothesize that volcanic tremor of Deception Island is a superposition of hybrid type events. The source of both types could be the interaction between thaw water and hot materials in a shallow aquifer.},

In this study, we develop a near-field tsunami prediction approach based on seismic array backprojections (BP). In this approach, the rupture area is first estimated by enclosing the BP radiators. Then slip models with uniform slip are constructed based on statistical scaling relations between rupture area and seismic moment to predict the near-field tsunami waveforms. The method is applied to the 2011 Tohoku, 2014 Iquique, and 2015 Illapel tsunami events, and the model predictions are compared with tsunami recordings at 57 tidal gauges and nine DART stations. Results show that the average error of arrival time and amplitude nearshore is approximately -15 to +5 min and 0.5 m, respectively, which are sufficiently small for tsunami warning purposes.},

  abstract = {Many systems arising in biological applications are subject to periodic forcing. In these systems the forcing parameter is not only time-varying but also known to have a periodic structure. We present an approach to estimate periodic, time-varying parameters using nonlinear Bayesian filtering. Most parameter estimation methodology in the literature is aimed at estimating constant parameters or parameters whose values drift over time with no imposed structure. The proposed technique imposes periodic structure by treating the time-varying parameter as a piecewise function with unknown coefficients, estimated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). This method allows the resulting parameter estimate more flexibility in shape than prescribing a specific functional form (e.g., sinusoidal) to model its behavior, while still maintaining periodicity. We compare the proposed method to an EnKF-based parameter drift algorithm, where periodicity is not guaranteed, using synthetic data generated from the FitzHugh-Nagumo system which models the spiking dynamics of a neuron. We further demonstrate the proposed method by estimating the seasonal transmission parameter in an epidemic model for the spread of measles. Results are obtained using time-series data of measles case reports from three locations during the pre-vaccine era, in particular the weekly reported cases in England and Wales (1948-1967) and monthly reported cases in New York City (1945-1964) and Baltimore (1928-1960). The augmented EnKF implementation also allows for simultaneous estimation of initial conditions and other static system parameters, such as the reporting probability of measles cases, which is vital for predicting under-reported incidence data.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two bio- logical examples: a synthetic example with data generated from the nonlinear FitzHugh-Nagumo system, modeling the excitability of a nerve cell, to estimate the external voltage parameter, and a case study using reported measles incidence data from three locations during the pre-vaccine era to estimate the seasonal transmission parameter.

In particular, Geiger's method and its variants do not properly capture the full uncertainty in model parameter estimates, which is characterized by the probability density function (PDF). For sparse observations, we show that this PDF can deviate significantly from the ellipsoidal form assumed in conventional methods.

  abstract = {For the purposes of eruption forecasting and hazard mitigation, a volcanic crisis may be represented as a staged progression of states of unrest, each with its own timescale and likelihood of transition to other states (or to climactic eruption). If the state conditions can be interpreted physically, e.g., in terms of advancing materials failure, this knowledge could be used directly to inform decisions on alert level setting. A multi-state Markov process provides one simple model for defining states and for estimating rates of switching between states. However, for eruptive processes, such states are not directly observable and must be inferred from latent markers, such as seismic activity, gas output, deformation rates, etc., some of which may be contradictory. Interpretations of uncertain data will be liable to error, so a model is needed which can simultaneously estimate both elements: the transition likelihood of a hidden process and the probabilities of state misclassification. We describe the concept and underlying principles of continuous-time hidden Markov models and demonstrate them in a decision-support context with a preliminary working implementation using MULTIMO data. Where multi-parameter streams of raw, processed or conditioned data of different kinds are available, these can be input in near real-time to appropriate hidden multi-state Markov models, the outputs of each providing their own objective analyses of eruptive state in probabilistic terms. These separate, multiple indicators of state can then be input into a Bayesian Belief Network framework for weighing and combining them as different strands of evidence, together with other observations, data, interpretations and expert judgment. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Eruptive column models are powerful tools for investigating the transport of volcanic gas and ash, reconstructing past explosive eruptions, and simulating future hazards. However, the evaluation of these models is challenging as it requires independent estimates of the main model inputs (e.g. mass eruption rate) and outputs (e.g. column height). There exists no database of independently estimated eruption source parameters (ESPs) that is extensive, standardized, maintained, and consensus-based. This paper introduces the Independent Volcanic Eruption Source Parameter Archive (IVESPA, ivespa.co.uk), a community effort endorsed by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) Commission on Tephra Hazard Modelling. We compiled data for 134 explosive eruptive events, spanning the 1902-2016 period, with independent estimates of: i) total erupted mass of fall deposits; ii) duration; iii) eruption column height; and iv) atmospheric conditions. Crucially, we distinguish plume top versus umbrella spreading height, and the height of ash versus sulphur dioxide injection. All parameter values provided have been vetted independently by at least two experts. Uncertainties are quantified systematically, including flags to describe the degree of interpretation of the literature required for each estimate. IVESPA also includes a range of additional parameters such as total grain size distribution, eruption style, morphology of the plume (weak versus strong), and mass contribution from pyroclastic density currents, where available. We discuss the future developments and potential applications of IVESPA and make recommendations for reporting ESPs to maximize their usability across different applications. IVESPA covers an unprecedented range of ESPs and can therefore be used to evaluate and develop eruptive column models across a wide range of conditions using a standardized dataset.},

  abstract = {We have implemented and tested an algorithm for onsite earthquake early warning (EEW) in California using the infrastructure of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). The algorithm relies on two parameters derived from the initial 3 sec of P waveform data at a single seismic sensor: period parameter \{tau\}c and high-pass filtered displacement amplitude Pd. Previous studies have determined empirical relationships between\{tau\} c and the moment magnitude Mw of an earthquake, and between Pd and the peak ground velocity (PGV) at the site of observation. In 2007, seven local earthquakes in southern California with 4.0[\&le;]ML[\&le;]4.7 have triggered the calculation of Mw and PGV by the EEW algorithm. While the mean values of estimated parameters were in the expected range, the scatter was large, in particular for the smallest events. During the same time period the EEW algorithm produced a large number of false triggers due to low trigger thresholds. To improve the real-time performance of the onsite approach, we have developed a new trigger criterion that is based on combinations of observed\{tau\} c and Pd values. This new criterion removes 97\% of previous false triggers and leads to a significant reduction of the scatter in magnitude estimates for small earthquakes.}

  abstract = {Earthquake EarlyWarning (EEW) predicts future ground shaking based on presently available data. Long ruptures present the best opportunities for EEW since many heavily shaken areas are distant from the earthquake epicentre and may receive long warning times. Predicting the shaking from large earthquakes, however, requires some estimate of the likelihood of the future evolution of an ongoing rupture. An EEW system that anticipates future rupture using the present magnitude (or rupture length) together with the Gutenberg-Richter frequency- size statistics will likely never predict a large earthquake, because of the rare occurrence of `extreme events'. However, it seems reasonable to assume that large slip amplitudes increase the probability for evolving into a large earthquake. To investigate the relationship between the slip and the eventual size of an ongoing rupture, we simulate suites of 1-D rupture series from stochastic models of spatially heterogeneous slip. We find that while large slip amplitudes increase the probability for the continuation of a rupture and the possible evolution into a `Big One', the recognition that rupture is occurring on a spatially smooth fault has an even stronger effect.We conclude that anEEWsystem for large earthquakes needs some mechanism for the rapid recognition of the causative fault (e.g., from real-time GPS measurements) and consideration of its `smoothness'. An EEW system for large earthquakes on smooth faults, such as the San Andreas Fault, could be implemented in two ways: the system could issue a warning, whenever slip on the fault exceeds a few metres, because the probability for a large earthquake is high and strong shaking is expected to occur in large areas around the fault. Amore sophisticated EEW system could use the present slip on the fault to estimate the future slip evolution and final rupture dimensions, and (using this information) could provide probabilistic predictions of seismic ground motions along the evolving rupture. The decision on whether an EEW system should be realized in the first or in the second way (or in a combination of both) is user-specific.},

  abstract = {Real-time applications such as earthquake early warning (EEW) typically use empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) along with event magnitude and source-tosite distances to estimate expected shaking levels. In this simplified approach, effects due to finite-fault geometry, directivity and site and basin response are often generalized, which may lead to a significant under- or overestimation of shaking from large earthquakes (M {$>$} 6.5) in some locations. For enhanced site-specific ground-motion predictions considering 3-D wavepropagation effects, we develop support vector regression (SVR) models from the SCEC CyberShake low-frequency ({$<$}0.5 Hz) and broad-band (0-10 Hz) data sets. CyberShake encompasses 3-D wave-propagation simulations of {$>$}415 000 finite-fault rupture scenarios (6.5 {$\leq$}M{$\leq$} 8.5) for southern California defined in UCERF 2.0.We use CyberShake to demonstrate the application of synthetic waveform data to EEW as a 'proof of concept', being aware that these simulations are not yet fully validated and might not appropriately sample the range of rupture uncertainty. Our regression models predict the maximum and the temporal evolution of instrumental intensity (MMI) at 71 selected test sites using only the hypocentre, magnitude and rupture ratio, which characterizes uni- and bilateral rupture propagation. Our regression approach is completely data-driven (where here the CyberShake simulations are considered data) and does not enforce pre-defined functional forms or dependencies among input parameters. The models were established from a subset (\textasciitilde 20 per cent) of CyberShake simulations, but can explain MMI values of all {$>$}400 k rupture scenarios with a standard deviation of about 0.4 intensity units. We apply our models to determine threshold magnitudes (and warning times) for various active faults in southern California that earthquakes need to exceed to cause at least 'moderate', 'strong' or 'very strong' shaking in the Los Angeles (LA) basin. These thresholds are used to construct a simple and robust EEW algorithm: to declare a warning, the algorithm only needs to locate the earthquake and to verify that the corresponding magnitude threshold is exceeded. The models predict that a relatively moderate M6.5-7 earthquake along the Palos Verdes, Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon, Elsinore or San Jacinto faults with a rupture propagating towards LA could cause 'very strong' to 'severe' shaking in the LA basin; however, warning times for these events could exceed 30 s. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2014.

Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory.

  abstract = {Hazard analysis at caldera volcanoes is challenging due to the wide range of eruptive and environmental conditions that can plausibly occur during renewed activity. Taupo volcano, New Zealand, is a frequently active and productive rhyolitic caldera volcano that has hosted the world's youngest known supereruption and numerous smaller explosive events. To assess ashfall hazard from future eruptions, we have simulated atmospheric ash dispersal using the Ash3d model. We consider five eruption scenarios spanning magma volumes of 0.1\textendash 500 km3 and investigate the main factors governing ash dispersal in modern atmospheric conditions. Our results are examined in the context of regional synoptic weather patterns (Kidson types) that provide a framework for assessing the variability of ashfall distribution in different wind fields. For the smallest eruptions ( 0.1-km3 magma), ashfall thicknesses {$>$}1 cm are largely confined to the central North Island, with dispersal controlled by day-to-day weather and the dominance of westerly winds. With increasing eruptive volume (1\textendash 5-km3 magma), ashfall thicknesses {$>$}1 cm would likely reach major population centers throughout the North Island. Dispersal is less dependent on weather patterns as the formation of a radially expanding umbrella cloud forces ash upwind or crosswind, although strong stratospheric winds significantly restrict umbrella spreading. For large eruptions (50\textendash 500-km3 magma), powerful expansion of the umbrella cloud results in widespread ashfall at damaging thicknesses ({$>$}10 cm) across most of the North Island and top of the South Island. Synoptic climatology may prove a useful additional technique for long-term hazard planning at caldera volcanoes.},

Taup\=o has also produced eruptions of a wide variety of sizes, styles and associated landscape responses over a {$\sim$}350 kyr period. Early Taup\=o ({$>$}54 ka) is poorly demarcated, merging with Maroa to the north, and is represented by widely scattered, geochemically distinct, effusive domes and explosive eruption products from vents all around the modern lake. Taup\=o had two independent magmatic systems from 54\textendash 25.5 ka, one that led to the Oruanui event focussed beneath the area of the modern lake and a second, northeast of the lake that has remained active to the present. Following the Oruanui supereruption, the rebuilt modern hyperactive Taup\=o magmatic system is primarily focussed beneath the lake and has generated 25 rhyolitic eruptions since {$\sim$}12 ka. The young rhyolite magmas come from an evolving silicic magma reservoir, but vary widely in their eruptive sizes and destructive potential. In the modern era Taup\=o experiences unrest every decade or so, but uncertainties remain over the nature of the magma reservoir and the processes that drive unrest or eruptive activity that require new geophysical data and interpretations.},

  abstract = {-We describe a method to invert regional or global scale surface-wave group or phase-velocity measurements to estimate 2-D models of the distribution and strength of isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic velocity variations. Such maps have at least two purposes in monitoring the nuclear Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT): (1) They can be used as data to estimate the shear velocity of the crust and uppermost mantle and topography on internal interfaces which are important in event location, and (2) they can be used to estimate surface-wave travel-time correction surfaces to be used in phase-matched filters designed to extract low signal-to-noise surface-wave packets.The purpose of this paper is to describe one useful path through the large number of options available in an inversion of surface-wave data. Our method appears to provide robust and reliable dispersion maps on both global and regional scales. The technique we describe has a number of features that have motivated its development and commend its use: (1) It is developed in a spherical geometry; (2) the region of inference is defined by an arbitrary simple closed curve so that the method works equally well on local, regional, or global scales; (3) spatial smoothness and model amplitude constraints can be applied simultaneously; (4) the selection of model regularization and the smoothing parameters is highly flexible which allows for the assessment of the effect of variations in these parameters; (5) the method allows for the simultaneous estimation of spatial resolution and amplitude bias of the images; and (6) the method optionally allows for the estimation of azimuthal anisotropy.We present examples of the application of this technique to observed surface-wave group and phase velocities globally and regionally across Eurasia and Antarctica.},

  abstract = {Rinc\'on de la Vieja (10.49 N, 85.19 W), the northernmost active volcano in Costa Rica, hosts a hot acidic crater lake, which frequently produces large phreatic to phreatomagmatic eruptions. Relatively little is known about this volcano, as it is poorly monitored due to remote location and difficulty of access. In February-May 2017, we deployed a Multi-GAS instrument to continuously monitor gas concentrations in the plume released by the vigorously degassing crater lake. The Multi-GAS station registered gas information from February 3 to May 9, 2017, a period during which many phreatic to phreatomagmatic eruptions occurred, 42 of which were recorded seismically. Nine of these eruptions were also registered in the Multi-GAS record as distinct gas pulses, representing the first measurements of gases explosively released during individual phreatic/phreatomagmatic explosions. Our results show that during background quiescent degassing the Rinc\'on de la Vieja crater lake plume was characterized by high CO2/SO2 ratios (64{$\pm$}59) and H2S/SO2 ratios of 0.57{$\pm$}0.20. This composition is interpreted as reflecting hydrothermal (re)processing of magma-sourced gas in the sub-limnic environment. Phreatic blasts were recorded by the Multi-GAS as brief (1-2 minutes long) pulses of elevated gas mixing ratios (up to \textasciitilde{} 52 ppmv SO2 and {$>$} 3000 ppmv CO2), or more than an order of magnitude higher than during background degassing (\textasciitilde{} 1 ppmv SO2 and \textasciitilde{} 450 ppmv CO2). During the phreatic eruption(s), the H2S/SO2 ratio was systematically lower ({$<$}0.18) than during background degassing, but the CO2/SO2 ratio remained high (and variable), ranging from 37 to 390. These compositions indicate a S-poor eruptive gas, suggesting that the source magmatic gas is extensively processed during pre-eruptive hydrothermal storage, most likely by native S deposition and by sulfate formation. Our gas results are thus overall consistent with a mechanism of phreatic eruptions triggered by accumulation of magmatic-hydrothermal gases beneath a hydrothermal system. We conclude that real-time Multi-GAS monitoring can provide key insights into the mechanisms driving phreatic eruptions at Rinc\'on de la Vieja, and perhaps at other similar volcanic lakes.},

  abstract = {Significant advances have been made in recent years in probabilistic analysis of geological hazards. Analyses of this kind are concerned with producing estimates of the probability of occurrence of a hazard at a site given the location, magnitude, and frequency of hazardous events around that site; in particular Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA). PSHA is a method for assessing and expressing the probability of earthquake hazard for a site of interest, at multiple spatial scales, in terms of probability of exceeding certain ground motion intensities. Probabilistic methods for multi-scale volcanic ash hazard assessment are less developed. The modelling framework presented here, Probabilistic Volcanic Ash Hazard Analysis (PVAHA), adapts the seismologically based PSHA technique for volcanic ash. PVAHA considers a magnitude-frequency distribution of eruptions and associated volcanic ash load attenuation relationships and integrates across all possible events to arrive at an annual exceedance probability for each site across a region of interest. The development and implementation of the Volcanic Ash Probabilistic Assessment tool for Hazard (VAPAH), as a mechanism for facilitating multi-scale PVAHA, is also introduced. VAPAH outputs are aggregated to generate maps that visualise the expected volcanic ash hazard for sites across a region at timeframes of interest and disaggregated to determine the causal factors which dominate volcanic ash hazard at individual sites. VAPAH can be used to identify priority areas for more detailed PVAHA or local scale ash dispersal modelling that can be used to inform disaster risk reduction efforts.},

  abstract = {Event trees are a popular technique for modelling accidents in system safety analyses. Bayesian networks are a probabilistic modelling technique representing influences between uncertain variables. Although popular in expert systems, Bayesian networks are not used widely for safety. Using a train derailment case study, we show how an event tree can be viewed as a Bayesian network, making it clearer when one event affects a later one. Since this effect needs to be understood to construct an event tree correctly, we argue that the two notations should be used together. We then show how the Bayesian Network enables the factors that influence the outcome of events to be represented explicitly. In the case study, this allowed the train derailment model to be generalised and applied in more circumstances. Although the resulting model is no longer just an event tree, the familiar event tree notation remains useful.},

  abstract = {We examine the application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to volcanic occurrences. The parameters in HMMs can be estimated from data by means of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Various formulations permit modelling the activity level of a volcano through onset counts, the intensity of a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP), or through the intervals between onsets. More elaborate models allow investigation of the relationship between durations and reposes. After fitting the model, the Viterbi algorithm can be used to identify the underlying (hidden) activity level of the volcano most consistent with the observations. The HMM readily provides forecasts of the next event, and is easily simulated. Data of flank eruptions 1600-2006 from Mount Etna are used to illustrate the methodology. We find that the volcano has longish periods of Poissonian behaviour, interspersed with less random periods, and that changes in regime may be more frequent than have previously been identified statistically. The flank eruptions of Mount Etna appear to have a complex time-predictable character, which is compatible with transitions between an open and closed conduit system. The relationship between reposes and durations appears to characterize the cyclic nature of the volcanoes activity. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Author Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2007 RAS.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the potential ash fall hazards from re-awakening volcanoes is a topic of great interest. While methods for calculating the probability of eruptions, and for numerical simulation of tephra dispersal and fallout exist, event records at most volcanoes that re-awaken sporadically on decadal to millennial cycles are inadequate to develop rigorous forecasts of occurrence, much less eruptive volume. Here we demonstrate a method by which eruption records from radiocarbon-dated sediment cores can be used to derive forecasting models for ash fall impacts on electrical infrastructure. Our method is illustrated by an example from the Taranaki region of New Zealand. Radiocarbon dates, expressed as years before present (B.P.), are used to define an age-depth model, classifying eruption ages (with associated errors) for a circa 1500\textendash 10500~year B.P. record at Mt. Taranaki (New Zealand). In addition, data describing the youngest 1500~years of eruption activity is obtained from directly dated proximal deposits. Absence of trend and apparent independence in eruption intervals is consistent with a renewal model using a mix of Weibulls distributions, which was used to generate probabilistic forecasts of eruption recurrence. After establishing that interval length and tephra thickness were independent in the record, a thickness\textendash volume relationship (from [Rhoades, D.A., Dowrick, D.J., Wilson, C.J.N., 2002. Volcanic hazard in New Zealand: Scaling and attenuation relations for tephra fall deposits from Taupo volcano. Nat. Hazards, 26:147\textendash 174]) was inverted to provide a frequency\textendash volume relationship for eruptions. Monte Carlo simulation of the thickness\textendash volume relationship was then used to produce probable ash fall thicknesses at any chosen site. Several critical electrical infrastructure sites in the Taranaki Region were analysed. This region, being the only gas and condensate-producing area in New Zealand, is of national economic importance, with activities in and around the area depending on uninterrupted power supplies. Forecasts of critical ash thicknesses (1~mm wet and 2~mm dry) that may cause short-circuiting, surges or power shutdowns in substations show that the annual probabilities of serious impact are between \textasciitilde 0.5\% and 27\% over a 50~year period. It was also found that while large eruptions with high ash plumes tend to affect ``expected'' areas in relation to prevailing winds, the direction impacts of small ash falls are far less predictable. In the Taranaki case study, areas out of normal downwind directions, but close to the volcano, have probabilities of impact for critical thicknesses of 1\textendash 2~mm of around half to 60\% of those in downwind directions and therefore should not be overlooked in hazard analysis. Through this method we are able to definitively show that the potential ash fall hazard to electrical infrastructure in this area is low in comparison to other natural threats, and provide a quantitative measure for use in risk analysis and budget prioritisation for hazard mitigation measures.},

  abstract = {We use ambient seismic noise to image the crust and uppermost mantle, and to determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of the noise field itself, and examine the way in which those characteristics may influence imaging results. Surface wave information extracted
 from ambient seismic noise using cross-correlation methods significantly enhances our knowledge of the crustal and uppermost mantle shear-velocity structure of New Zealand. We assemble a large dataset of three-component broadband continuous seismic data from
 temporary and permanent seismic stations, increasing the achievable resolution of surface wave velocity maps in comparison to a previous study.
 Three-component data enables us to examine both Rayleigh and Love waves using noise cross-correlation functions. Employing a Monte Carlo inversion method, we invert Rayleigh and Love wave phase and group velocity dispersion curves separately for spatially
 averaged isotropic shear velocity models beneath the Northland Peninsula. The results yield first-order radial anisotropy estimates of  2\% in the upper crust and up to 15\% in the lower crust, and estimates of Moho depth and uppermost mantle velocity compatible with previous studies.
 We also construct a high-resolution, pseudo-3D image of the shear-velocity distribution in the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the central North Island using Rayleigh and Love waves. We document, for the first time, the lateral extent of low shear-velocity zones in
 the upper and mid-crust beneath the highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone, which have been reported previously based on spatially confined 1D shear-velocity profiles. Attributing these low shear-velocities to the presence of partial melt, we use an empirical relation to
 estimate an average percentage of partial melt of {$<$} 4:2\% in the upper and middle crust.
 Analysis of the ambient seismic noise field in the North Island using plane wave beamforming
 and slant stacking indicates that higher mode Rayleigh waves can be detected, in
 addition to the fundamental mode. The azimuthal distributions of seismic noise sources
 inferred from beamforming are compatible with high near-coastal ocean wave heights in
 the period band of the secondary microseism (\textasciitilde 7 s). Averaged over 130 days, the distribution
 of seismic noise sources is azimuthally homogeneous, indicating that the seismic
 noise field is well-suited to noise cross-correlation studies. This is underpinned by the
 good agreement of our results with those from previous studies. The effective homogeneity
 of the seismic noise field and the large dataset of noise cross-correlation functions we
 here compiled, provide the cornerstone for future studies of ambient seismic noise and
 crustal shear velocity structure in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {The feasibility of earthquake early warning (EEW) is now widely recognized. However, EEWsystems that are in operation or under evaluation worldwide have significant variations and are usually operated independently of routine earthquake monitoring. We introduce a software that allows testing and evaluation of a well-known EEWalgorithm directly within a widely used earthquake monitoring software platform. In the long term, we envision this approach can lead to (1) an easier transition from prototype to production type EEW implementations, (2) a natural and seamless evolution from very fast EEW source parameter estimates with typically large uncertainties to more delayed but more precise estimates using more traditional analysis methods, and (3) the capability of seismic networks to evaluate the readiness of their network for EEW, and to implement EEW, without having to invest in and maintain separate, independent software systems. Using the Virtual Seismologist (VS), a popular EEW algorithm that has been tested in real time in California since 2008, we demonstrate how our approach can be realized within the widely used monitoring platform SeisComP3. Because this software suite is already in production at many seismic networks worldwide, we have been able to test the new VS implementation across a wide variety of tectonic settings and network infrastructures. Using mainly real-time performance, we analyze over 3200 events with magnitudes between 2.0 and 6.8 and show that, for shallow crustal seismicity, 68\% of the first VS magnitude estimates are within 0:5 magnitude units of the final reported magnitude. We further demonstrate the very significant effect of data communication strategies on final alert times. Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we then model the best possible alert times for optimally configured EEWsystems and show that, for events within the dense parts of each of the seven test networks, effective warnings could be issued for magnitudes as small as M 5.0.

  abstract = {The ability to fully evaluate potential relationships between forest management and bats is limited without information from relevant spatial scales. Further, knowledge of bat ecology in intensively managed forests is fairly limited even though these forests are a substantial portion of the forested landscape in the southeastern U.S. Therefore, we used occupancy models to examine influence of small-scale vegetation characteristics and large-scale spatial features on foraging patterns of bats within 6 managed-pine (Pinus spp.) forest landscapes in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. We conducted repeated acoustic surveys to determine species presence/non-detection and evaluated a priori models relating detection probability and occupancy to site- and landscape-level metrics for 6 species/genera. Detection of big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and eastern red (Lasiurus borealis)/Seminole (L. seminolus) bats (eastern red and Seminole bats combined) decreased with increasing basal area, and detection of big brown and Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) increased over the summer sampling period. Relationships between occupancy and habitat metrics were species-specific but consistent with previous studies. Occupancy for most bat species was lower at sampling sites with higher vegetation clutter and higher basal area. In contrast to most previous studies, occupancy of all bat species investigated was unrelated to or negatively influenced by distance to water. Although site- and landscape-level features influenced occupancy, our results indicate that site-specific features (vegetation clutter and basal area) influenced most species. Therefore, stand-level management activities that decrease vegetation structure, such as thinning intermediate-aged stands and/or controlling midstory vegetation (e.g., fire or herbicide applications), likely will maintain or increase suitability of managed pine forest stands and landscapes for many bat species in the southeastern Coastal Plain. The forest mosaics that we sampled, consisting primarily of managed pine stands intermingled with non-production habitat types, supported a large proportion of the bat community associated with forests of the Coastal Plain which suggests the compatibility of timber production and bat conservation objectives.},

  abstract = {Tarawera volcano (New Zealand) is volumetrically dominated by rhyolitic lavas and pyroclastic deposits, but the most recent event in AD 1886 was a basaltic plinian fissure eruption. In March 2019 a swarm of at least 64 earthquakes occurred to the NE of Tarawera volcano, as recorded by the New Zealand Geohazard Monitoring Network (GeoNet). We use seismological analysis to show that this swarm was most likely caused by a dyke intrusion that intruded into the brittle crust between depths of 8\textendash 10 km and propagated towards Tarawera volcano for 2 km at a rate of 0.3\textendash 0.6 m s\$\^\{-1\}\$. We infer that this was a dyke of basaltic composition that was stress-guided towards Tarawera volcano by the topographic load of the volcanic edifice. A similar process may have occurred during the 1886 eruption with a dyke sourced from some lateral distance away from the volcano. The 2019 intrusion was not detected by InSAR geodesy and we use synthetic models to show that geodetic monitoring could only detect a \&gt;6 m wide dyke at these depths. Improvements to geodetic monitoring, combined with detailed seismological analysis, could better detect future magmatic intrusions in the region and serve to help assess ongoing changes in the magmatic system and the associated possibilities of a volcanic event.},

For such scientists, there is a need to keep up to date with several recent advances in Monte Carlo methodologies such as cluster methods, data- augmentation, simulated tempering and other auxiliary variable methods. There is also a trend in moving towards a population-based approach. All these advances in one way or another were motivated by the need to sample from very complex distribution for which traditional methods would tend to be trapped in local energy minima. It is our aim to provide a self-contained and up to date treatment of the Monte Carlo method to this audience. The Monte Carlo method is a computer-based statistical sampling approach for solving numerical problems concerned with a complex system. The methodology was initially developed in the field of statistical physics during the early days of electronic computing (1945-55) and has now been adopted by researchers in almost all scientific fields. The fundamental idea for constructing Markov chain based Monte Carlo algorithms was introduced in the 1950s. This idea was later extended to handle more and more complex physical systems. In the 1980s, statisticians and computer scientists developed Monter Carlo-based algorithms for a wide variety of integration and optimization tasks. In the 1990s, the method began to play an important role in computational biology. Over the past fifty years, reasearchers in diverse scientific fields have studied the Monte Carlo method and contributed to its development. Today, a large number of scientisits and engineers employ Monte Carlo techniques as an essential tool in their work.

  abstract = {The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.},

  abstract = {[1] A global set of present plate boundaries on the Earth is presented in digital form. Most come from sources in the literature. A few boundaries are newly interpreted from topography, volcanism, and/or seismicity, taking into account relative plate velocities from magnetic anomalies, moment tensor solutions, and/or geodesy. In addition to the 14 large plates whose motion was described by the NUVEL-1A poles (Africa, Antarctica, Arabia, Australia, Caribbean, Cocos, Eurasia, India, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, North America, Pacific, Philippine Sea, South America), model PB2002 includes 38 small plates (Okhotsk, Amur, Yangtze, Okinawa, Sunda, Burma, Molucca Sea, Banda Sea, Timor, Birds Head, Maoke, Caroline, Mariana, North Bismarck, Manus, South Bismarck, Solomon Sea, Woodlark, New Hebrides, Conway Reef, Balmoral Reef, Futuna, Niuafo'ou, Tonga, Kermadec, Rivera, Galapagos, Easter, Juan Fernandez, Panama, North Andes, Altiplano, Shetland, Scotia, Sandwich, Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Somalia), for a total of 52 plates. No attempt is made to divide the Alps-Persia-Tibet mountain belt, the Philippine Islands, the Peruvian Andes, the Sierras Pampeanas, or the California-Nevada zone of dextral transtension into plates; instead, they are designated as "orogens" in which this plate model is not expected to be accurate. The cumulative-number/area distribution for this model follows a power law for plates with areas between 0.002 and 1 steradian. Departure from this scaling at the small-plate end suggests that future work is very likely to define more very small plates within the orogens. The model is presented in four digital files: a set of plate boundary segments; a set of plate outlines; a set of outlines of the orogens; and a table of characteristics of each digitization step along plate boundaries, including estimated relative velocity vector and classification into one of 7 types (continental convergence zone, continental transform fault, continental rift, oceanic spreading ridge, oceanic transform fault, oceanic convergent boundary, subduction zone). Total length, mean velocity, and total rate of area production/destruction are computed for each class; the global rate of area production and destruction is 0.108 m 2/s, which is higher than in previous models because of the incorporation of back-arc spreading. \^A\textcopyright{} 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The characteristics of the heat emitted relate directly to the geological processes underway and can be observed from space, using the thermal sensors present on many Earth-orbiting satellites. For over 50 years, scientists have utilised such sensors and are now able to determine the sort of volcanic activity being displayed without hazardous and costly field expeditions. This review will describe the theoretical basis of the discipline and then discuss the sensors available and the history of their use.

  abstract = {The various uncertainties in the earthquake-triggered tsunami threat assessment are difficult to quantify and/or integrate into the tsunami early warning process. Uncertainties in the (seismic) input parameters and the lack of knowledge about the earthquake slip distribution contribute most to the total uncertainty in real-time evaluated tsunami assessment. We present a method how to integrate and quantify these uncertainties in the warning process by evaluating a tsunami warning level probability distribution with a Bayesian network (BN) approach. As soon as an earthquake is detected, the seismic source parameter estimates are evaluated and a probabilistic overview on different tsunami warning levels is provided, feasible to support a decision maker at a warning center with important additional data. A BN system has been developed exemplarily for the region Sumatra. In this paper, we describe the method of BN generation by ancestral sampling, we critically analyse the assumptions made and weight the pro and cons of the BN approach. A case study demonstrates the workflow of the BN system in real-time and reveals the promising power of a BN analysis in the framework of early warning. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

Based on a dedicated benchmark exercise and on 3 days of in-depth discussion, recommendations have been made for future model improvements, new strategies of ash cloud forecasting, multidisciplinary data acquisition and more efficient communication between different communities. Issues addressed in the workshop include ash dispersal modelling, uncertainty, ensemble forecasting, combining dispersal models and observations, sensitivity analysis, model variability, data acquisition, pre-eruption forecasting, first simulation and data assimilation, research priorities and new communication strategies to improve information flow and operational routines. As a main conclusion, model developers, meteorologists, volcanologists and stakeholders need to work closely together to develop new and improved strategies for ash dispersal forecasting and, in particular, to: (1) improve the definition of the source term, (2) design models and forecasting strategies that can better characterize uncertainties, (3) explore and identify the best ensemble strategies that can be adapted to ash dispersal forecasting, (4) identify optimized strategies for the combination of models and observations and (5) implement new critical operational strategies. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Tephra dispersal and sedimentation mostly depends on particle characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and plume dynamics, with the potential of affecting the environment and society at multiple scales. In particular, thinning trends of tephra deposits mostly depend on particle Reynolds number, which defines different fallout regimes. Nonetheless, particle\textendash particle interactions (e.g., particle aggregation) and gravitational instabilities can strongly affect the particle residence time in the atmosphere promoting premature fallout of the finest fraction ({$<$}100 {$\mu$}m). Several analytical and numerical models have been developed to describe both particle transport and settling with the intent of better understanding dispersal dynamics, quantifying the associated hazards, and determining the main eruption source parameters by solving inverse problems. A full characterization of tephra dispersal and sedimentation can only be achieved through a critical synergy of multiple approaches.},

  abstract = {Displacements derived from many of the accelerogram recordings of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake show drifts when only a simple baseline derived from the pre-event portion of the record is removed from the records. The appearance of the velocity and displacement records suggests that changes in the zero level of the acceleration are responsible for these drifts. The source of the shifts in zero level are unknown, but in at least one case it is almost certainly due to tilting of the ground. This article illustrates the effect on the ground velocity, ground displacement, and response spectra of several schemes for accounting for these baseline shifts. A wide range of final displacements can be obtained for various choices of baseline correction, and comparison with nearby GPS stations (none of which are colocated with the accelerograph stations) do not help in choosing the appropriate baseline correction. The results suggest that final displacements estimated from the records should be used with caution. The most important conclusion for earthquake engineering purposes, however, is that the response spectra for periods less than about 20 sec are usually unaffected by the baseline correction. Although limited to the analysis of only a small number of recordings, the results may have more general significance both for the many other recordings of this earthquake and for data that will be obtained in the future from similar high-quality accelerograph networks now being installed or soon to be installed in many parts of the world.},

The whole section on array seismology in that issue of the Manual was no longer than two pages, including one figure; array seismology being at that time more a matter of some specialists rather than a commonly applied technique. During the last two decades, new seismic arrays were installed all over the globe and, due to digital data acquisition systems and digital signal processing, it has become easier to handle the large amount of data from seismic arrays. Therefore, array observations have become more commonly used. This requires a separate Chapter on array seismology in the New Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice, which explains the principles of seismic arrays and how their data can be used to analyze seismic observations. In the following sections we define first the term 'seismic array' and show examples of seismic arrays installed around the world. We then describe the theoretical basics of the processing of seismic data observed with an array, continue with the explanation of helpful tools for automatic analysis of array data and explain how local and regional events are located at the NORSAR Data Processing Center by using single array observations. Finally, we describe some helpful rules and procedures to find the best configuration for a seismic array and present a table of operational and planed seismic arrays.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of strong earthquakes with resembling source mechanisms in the Romanian Vrancea zone, SE Carpathians, allows for designing a simple, cheep and robust earthquake early warning (EEW) system for Bucharest with leading times of about 25 s. A previously established scaling relation for EEW predicts in the range from 1-2 s a ten times higher ground motion amplitude in Bucharest than the maximum P-wave acceleration measured in the epicentral area. Using additional weak and strong motion data, we find that ground shaking in Bucharest is generally overestimated by this relation by a factor of two. However, the predicted amplitudes are within the 95\% confidence interval of our revised relation. Additional predictive laws for EEW are determined for different ground motion parameters. The application of our scaling relations to the October 27, 2004 Vrancea earthquake (Mw= 6.0) supports the feasibility of the approach for EEW in Romania.

  abstract = {We have implemented and tested an algorithm for onsite earthquake early warning (EEW) in California using the infrastructure of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). The algorithm relies on two parameters derived from the initial 3 sec of P waveform data at a single seismic sensor: period parameter {$\tau$}c and high-pass filtered displacement amplitude Pd. Previous studies have determined empirical relationships between {$\tau$}c and the moment magnitude Mw of an earthquake, and between Pd and the peak ground velocity (PGV) at the site of observation. In 2007, seven local earthquakes in southern California with 4.0 {$\leq$} ML {$\leq$} 4.7 have triggered the calculation of Mw and PGV by the EEW algorithm. While the mean values of estimated parameters were in the expected range, the scatter was large, in particular for the smallest events. During the same time period the EEW algorithm produced a large number of false triggers due to low trigger thresholds. To improve the real-time performance of the onsite approach, we have developed a new trigger criterion that is based on combinations of observed {$\tau$}c and Pd values. This new criterion removes 97\% of previous false triggers and leads to a significant reduction of the scatter in magnitude estimates for small earthquakes.}

  abstract = {Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) predicts future ground shaking based on presently available data. Long ruptures present the best opportunities for EEW since many heavily shaken areas are distant from the earthquake epicentre and may receive long warning times. Predicting the shaking from large earthquakes, however, requires some estimate of the likelihood of the future evolution of an ongoing rupture. An EEW system that anticipates future rupture using the present magnitude (or rupture length) together with the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size statistics will likely never predict a large earthquake, because of the rare occurrence of 'extreme events'. However, it seems reasonable to assume that large slip amplitudes increase the probability for evolving into a large earthquake. To investigate the relationship between the slip and the eventual size of an ongoing rupture, we simulate suites of 1-D rupture series from stochastic models of spatially heterogeneous slip. We find that while large slip amplitudes increase the probability for the continuation of a rupture and the possible evolution into a 'Big One', the recognition that rupture is occurring on a spatially smooth fault has an even stronger effect. We conclude that an EEW system for large earthquakes needs some mechanism for the rapid recognition of the causative fault (e.g., from real-time GPS measurements) and consideration of its 'smoothness'. An EEW system for large earthquakes on smooth faults, such as the San Andreas Fault, could be implemented in two ways: the system could issue a warning, whenever slip on the fault exceeds a few metres, because the probability for a large earthquake is high and strong shaking is expected to occur in large areas around the fault. A more sophisticated EEW system could use the present slip on the fault to estimate the future slip evolution and final rupture dimensions, and (using this information) could provide probabilistic predictions of seismic ground motions along the evolving rupture. The decision on whether an EEW system should be realized in the first or in the second way (or in a combination of both) is user-specific. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2010 RAS.},

  abstract = {To provide rapid estimates of fault rupture extent during large earthquakes, we have developed the Finite Fault Rupture Detector algorithm, 'FinDer'. FinDer uses image recognition techniques to detect automatically surface-projected fault ruptures in real-time (assuming a line source) by estimating their current centroid position, length L, and strike \texttheta. The approach is based on a rapid high-frequency near/far-source classification of ground motion amplitudes in a dense seismic network (station spacing {$<$}50 km), and comparison with a set of pre-calculated templates using 'Matching by Correlation'. To increase computational efficiency, we perform the correlation in the wavenumber domain. FinDer keeps track of the current dimensions of a rupture in progress. Errors in L are typically on the same order as station spacing in the network. The continuously updated estimates of source geometries as provided by FinDer make predicted shaking intensities more accurate and thus more useful for earthquake early warning, ShakeMaps, and related products. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated for several recorded and simulated earthquakes with different focal mechanisms, including the 2009 M w 6.3 L'Aquila (Italy), the 1999 M w 7.6 ChiChi (Taiwan) and the M w 7.8 ShakeOut scenario earthquake on the southern San Andreas Fault (California). \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2012 RAS.},

  abstract = {Real-time applications such as earthquake early warning (EEW) typically use empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) along with event magnitude and source-tosite distances to estimate expected shaking levels. In this simplified approach, effects due to finite-fault geometry, directivity and site and basin response are often generalized, which may lead to a significant under- or overestimation of shaking from large earthquakes (M {$>$} 6.5) in some locations. For enhanced site-specific ground-motion predictions considering 3-D wavepropagation effects, we develop support vector regression (SVR) models from the SCEC CyberShake low-frequency ({$<$}0.5 Hz) and broad-band (0-10 Hz) data sets. CyberShake encompasses 3-D wave-propagation simulations of {$>$}415 000 finite-fault rupture scenarios (6.5 {$\leq$}M{$\leq$} 8.5) for southern California defined in UCERF 2.0.We use CyberShake to demonstrate the application of synthetic waveform data to EEW as a 'proof of concept', being aware that these simulations are not yet fully validated and might not appropriately sample the range of rupture uncertainty. Our regression models predict the maximum and the temporal evolution of instrumental intensity (MMI) at 71 selected test sites using only the hypocentre, magnitude and rupture ratio, which characterizes uni- and bilateral rupture propagation. Our regression approach is completely data-driven (where here the CyberShake simulations are considered data) and does not enforce pre-defined functional forms or dependencies among input parameters. The models were established from a subset (\textasciitilde 20 per cent) of CyberShake simulations, but can explain MMI values of all {$>$}400 k rupture scenarios with a standard deviation of about 0.4 intensity units. We apply our models to determine threshold magnitudes (and warning times) for various active faults in southern California that earthquakes need to exceed to cause at least 'moderate', 'strong' or 'very strong' shaking in the Los Angeles (LA) basin. These thresholds are used to construct a simple and robust EEW algorithm: to declare a warning, the algorithm only needs to locate the earthquake and to verify that the corresponding magnitude threshold is exceeded. The models predict that a relatively moderate M6.5-7 earthquake along the Palos Verdes, Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon, Elsinore or San Jacinto faults with a rupture propagating towards LA could cause 'very strong' to 'severe' shaking in the LA basin; however, warning times for these events could exceed 30 s. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2014.

  abstract = {We invert Rayleigh waves reconstructed from cross-correlations of 18 months of ambient seismic noise recorded by permanent seismological stations run by the Piton de la Fournaise Volcanological Observatory. By correlating noise records between 21 receivers, we reconstruct Rayleigh waves with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for 210 interstation paths. We use the reconstructed waveforms to measure group velocity dispersion curves at periods between 1.5 and 4.5 s. The obtained measurements are inverted for two-dimensional group velocity maps and finally for a 3-D S-wave velocity model of the edifice from +2 to -1 km above sea level. Our results clearly show a high velocity body spatially delimited by the borders of the active 10 km wide caldera. The preferential N30\textdegree -N130\textdegree{} orientations of this anomaly at -0.5 km below sea-level is an evidence of the preferential paths of magma injections associated to the NE-SE Rift Zones. This structure is surrounded by a low-velocity ring interpreted as effusive products associated to the construction of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano on the flank of the older Piton des Neiges volcano.

The 2003 San Simeon and 2004 Parkfield earthquakes both reduced seismic velocities that were measured from correlations of the ambient seismic noise and induced an increased nonvolcanic tremor activity along the San Andreas fault. After the Parkfield earthquake, velocity reduction and nonvolcanic tremor activity remained elevated for more than 3 years and decayed over time, similarly to afterslip derived from GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements. These observations suggest that the seismic velocity changes are related to co-seismic damage in the shallow layers and to deep co-seismic stress change and postseismic stress relaxation within the San Andreas fault zone.},

  abstract = {Noise-based seismology is proving to be a complementary ap- proach to active-source or earthquake-based methods for im- aging and monitoring the Earth's interior. Until recently, however, noise-based imaging and monitoring relied mostly on the inversion of surface waves reconstructed from corre- lations of mostly microseismic seismic noise (around 5 s of period). Compared to body-wave tomography and consider- ing similar wavelengths, surface-wave tomography succeeds in retrieving lateral subsurface velocity contrasts but is less effi- cient in resolving velocity perturbations at depth. Recently, the use of large-N seismic arrays has proven to be of great benefit for extracting body waves from noise correlations by stacking over a large number of receiver pairs and by ap- plying array processing. In this article, we describe a recent large-N array experiment that we conducted on Piton de la Fournaise (PdF). Our main goal was to extract body waves traveling directly in the vicinity of the active magma reservoir located at {$\sim$}2:5km depth below the summit crater using noise correlations between arrays of seismic sensors. Within this article, we provide technical information about the Vol- cArray experiment, which consisted of the deployment of 300 seismic nodes during one month on PdF. We also present data-quality measurements and show how the short-period seismometers that we used compare to standard broadband seismic records. Finally, we show noise array beamforming re- sults to study the content of seismic noise at frequencies be- tween 1 and 12 Hz and discuss the ability to use these data to recover body waves between arrays from the correlation of ambient seismic noise.

The method uses one or more particles, which explore a mixture of nested probability distributions, each successive distribution occupying \textasciitilde e\^-1 times the enclosed prior mass of the previous distribution. While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration fits naturally into this technique. We illustrate the new method on a test problem and find that it can achieve four times the accuracy of classic MCMC-based Nested Sampling, for the same computational effort; equivalent to a factor of 16 speedup. An additional benefit is that more samples and a more accurate evidence value can be obtained simply by continuing the run for longer, as in standard MCMC.},

The marginal likelihood, also known as the ``evidence'', is a key quantity in Bayesian model selection. The diffusive nested sampling algorithm, a variant of nested sampling, is a powerful tool for generating posterior samples and estimating marginal likelihoods. It is effective at solving complex problems including many where the posterior distribution is multimodal or has strong dependencies between variables. DNest4 is an open source (MIT licensed), multi-threaded implementation of this algorithm in C++11, along with associated utilities including: (i) `RJObject', a class template for finite mixture models; and (ii) a Python package allowing basic use without C++ coding. In this paper we demonstrate DNest4 usage through examples including simple Bayesian data analysis, finite mixture models, and approximate Bayesian computation.},

However, to date, there are no measurements inside these currents to quantify the dynamics of this important hazard process. Here we show, through large-scale experiments and the first field measurement of pressure inside pyroclastic surges, that dynamic pressure energy is mostly carried by large-scale coherent turbulent structures and gravity waves. These perpetuate as low-frequency high-pressure pulses downcurrent, form maxima in the flow energy spectra and drive a turbulent energy cascade. The pressure maxima exceed mean values, which are traditionally estimated for hazard assessments, manifold. The frequency of the most energetic coherent turbulent structures is bounded by a critical Strouhal number of \textasciitilde 0.3, allowing quantitative predictions. This explains the destructiveness of real-world flows through the development of c. 1\textendash 20 successive high-pressure pulses per minute. This discovery, which is also applicable to powder snow avalanches, necessitates a re-evaluation of hazard models that aim to forecast and mitigate volcanic hazard impacts globally.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of the CO2 output from arc volcanism requires a precise understanding of the potential along-arc variations in volcanic gas chemistry, and ultimately of the magmatic gas signature of each individual arc segment. In an attempt to more fully constrain the magmatic gas signature of the Central America Volcanic Arc (CAVA), we present here the results of a volcanic gas survey performed during March and April 2013 at five degassing volcanoes within the Costa Rica-Nicaragua volcanic segment (CNVS). Observations of the volcanic gas plume made with a multicomponent gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) have allowed characterization of the CO2/SO2-ratio signature of the plumes at Po\'as (0.30{$\pm$}0.06, mean {$\pm$} SD), Rinc\'on de la Vieja (27.0{$\pm$}15.3), and Turrialba (2.2{$\pm$}0.8) in Costa Rica, and at Telica (3.0{$\pm$}0.9) and San Crist\'obal (4.2{$\pm$}1.3) in Nicaragua (all ratios on molar basis). By scaling these plume compositions to simultaneously measured SO2 fluxes, we estimate that the CO2 outputs at CNVS volcanoes range from low (25.5{$\pm$}11.0 tons/day at Po\'as) to moderate (918 to 1270 tons/day at Turrialba). These results add a new information to the still fragmentary volcanic CO2 output data set, and allow estimating the total CO2 output from the CNVS at 2835{$\pm$}1364 tons/day. Our novel results, with previously available information about gas emissions in Central America, are suggestive of distinct volcanic gas CO2/ST (= SO2 + H2S)-ratio signature for magmatic volatiles in Nicaragua (\textasciitilde 3) relative to Costa Rica (\textasciitilde 0.5-1.0). We also provide additional evidence for the earlier theory relating the CO2-richer signature of Nicaragua volcanism to increased contributions from slab-derived fluids, relative to more-MORB-like volcanism in Costa Rica. The sizeable along-arc variations in magmatic gas chemistry that the present study has suggested indicate that additional gas observations are urgently needed to more-precisely confine the volcanic CO2 from the CAVA, and from global arc volcanism.},

If, in addition, precursory increases in thermal emissions are observed, an integrated mechanistic model for volcanic activity may be developed with the potential for forecasting eruptions. Crater-lake volcanoes provide an interesting target for such studies since thermal output can be monitored simply through lake water calotimetry. Here we summarize 10 years of gravity and thermal data from PO\& volcano, Costa Rica. Mass/energy balance calculations demonstrate that, in the steady-state, the large thermal inertia of the crater lake acts as a buffer to short-term changes in the energy input from the cooling magma feeder pipe. Since February 1986, it is postulated that there has been gradual emplacement of a shallow magma intrusion associated with vesiculation and gas loss to the surface. This follows from unambiguous, gravity increases, constrained by elevation control, that are coincident in time with a period of long-term increased energy input to the crater lake. Progressive reduction of the lake volume by evaporation/seepage culminated in an (April 1989) ash eruption providing a good documented record of combined gravity and thermodynamic precursors to volcanic activity.},

Three algorithms were expanded and examined during the study. Here we discuss the history, methodology, and performance of one of the algorithms, ElarmS. Earthquake Alarm Systems, or ElarmS, uses peak displacement and maximum predominant frequency of the P-wave to detect earthquakes and quantify their hazard in the seconds after rupture begins. ElarmS was developed for Northern and Southern California, and now processes waveforms in realtime from 603 seismic sensors across the state. We outline the methodology as currently implemented, present several example events from different regions of California, and summarize the performance in terms of false and missed alarms. ElarmS was also tested offline with a dataset of 84 large magnitude earthquakes from Japan. The results from the Japan dataset were used to create a statistical error model for the algorithm. The model can be used to provide realtime uncertainty estimates at any stage in processing. In August 2009 the CISN embarked on a second three-year study of earthquake early warning. As part of this ongoing research, we identify the technological and methodological challenges facing ElarmS. Telemetry latencies and false alarm rates are two key opportunities for improvement. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In July 2009, the California Integrated Seismic Network concluded a three-year study of earthquake early warning systems in California. Three algorithms were expanded and examined during the study. Here we discuss the history, methodology, and performance of one of the algorithms, ElarmS. Earthquake Alarm Systems, or ElarmS, uses peak displacement and maximum predominant frequency of the P-wave to detect earthquakes and quantify their hazard in the seconds after rupture begins. ElarmS was developed for Northern and Southern California, and now processes waveforms in realtime from 603 seismic sensors across the state. We outline the methodology as currently implemented, present several example events from different regions of California, and summarize the performance in terms of false and missed alarms. ElarmS was also tested offline with a dataset of 84 large magnitude earthquakes from Japan. The results from the Japan dataset were used to create a statistical error model for the algorithm. The model can be used to provide realtime uncertainty estimates at any stage in processing. In August 2009 the CISN embarked on a second three-year study of earthquake early warning. As part of this ongoing research, we identify the technological and methodological challenges facing ElarmS. Telemetry latencies and false alarm rates are two key opportunities for improvement.},

  abstract = {Seismicity associated with the 1995-1996 eruptions of Ruapehu reflects processes associated with the intrusion of magma to shallow depth in the volcanic edifice, its subsequent eruption, and changes in the volcanic plumbing system resulting from the eruptions. The sequence consisted of two distinct periods of eruptive activity, the first lasting from September 17, 1995 until late-October or early-November 1995 and the second from June 16, 1996 until late-July 1996. Immediately prior to and during the early stages of the 1995 eruptions, seismicity was similar to that recorded at Ruapehu during the previous 25 years, with the exception of the occurrence between September 17 and 25, 1995 of sub-1 Hz tremor, which is thought to represent magmatic intrusion. In early-October, a new pattern of seismicity was established with the disappearance of the 2 Hz tremor resonator source and a change to wideband (2-10 Hz) tremor and wideband volcanic earthquakes. This change coincided with the ejection of the last vestiges of Crater Lake and the change in eruptive style from phreatomagmatic to magmatic. Seismicity associated with the 1996 eruptions was very similar to that which accompanied the later part of the 1995 activity, implying the same eruption processes and that no significant changes had occurred in the volcanic plumbing system during the intervening period. Geochemical, geodetic, and seismic precursors to the 1995 eruptions were both minor and inconsistent, highlighting the difficulty in forecasting these eruptions. Furthermore, deep volcano-tectonic earthquakes were extremely rare throughout the 1995 and 1996 eruptive sequences, suggesting that stresses associated with magmatic intrusion were minor. This most likely resulted from the existence of either an open or a ductile pathway from the deep magma source to the surface prior to the eruptions and because the volume of magma intruded and subsequently erupted was relatively small ({$<$} 0.05 km(3)).

Nevertheless, seismic data labeling still requires substantial annotation efforts, often delayed in time if the eruptive state alters the data conditions. The selective segmentation of which earthquake transients have to be reviewed by an expert can significantly reduce annotation time, speed up algorithmic training, and boost monitoring adaptability to unforeseen situations. In this work, we propose a Bayesian temporal convolutional neural network (B-TCN) to perform continuous detection and classification while extracting the most uncertain events from the continuous data stream. Formulated as an active learning (AL) procedure, our B-TCN outputs an uncertainty map over time, highlighting the class memberships that need to be reviewed. We attain a significant improvement in monitoring metrics, with only a fraction of the initial dataset to achieve a recognition performance of 83\% for four seismo-volcanic events.},

Further, by retaining the explicit ray parameter dependence and hence a more direct relationship with the ray integrals, the delay-time method offers more flexibility in organizing suites of related phases and in tailoring the algorithm to meet specific computational requirements than does the travel-time table approach.

Cluster analysis indicated consistent clusters of boundary management practices related to varying segmentation and integration of the work and personal life domains. But, the authors suggest that the segmentation-integration continuum may be more complicated. Results also indicated relationships between boundary management practices and work-personal life interference and work-personal life enhancement.

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

  abstract = {We formulate, and present a numerical method for solving, an inverse problem for inferring parameters of a deterministic model from stochastic observational data (quantities of interest). The solution, given as a probability measure, is derived using a Bayesian updating approach for measurable maps that finds a posterior probability measure, that when propagated through the deterministic model produces a push-forward measure that exactly matches the observed probability measure on the data. Our approach for finding such posterior measures, which we call consistent Bayesian inference, is simple and only requires the computation of the push-forward probability measure induced by the combination of a prior probability measure and the deterministic model. We establish existence and uniqueness of observation-consistent posteriors and present stability and error analysis. We also discuss the relationships between consistent Bayesian inference, classical/statistical Bayesian inference, and a recently developed measure-theoretic approach for inference. Finally, analytical and numerical results are presented to highlight certain properties of the consistent Bayesian approach and the differences between this approach and the two aforementioned alternatives for inference.},

  abstract = {Real-time assessment of the state of a volcano plays a key role for civil protection purposes. Unfortunately, because of the coupling of highly nonlinear and partially known complex volcanic processes, and the intrinsic uncertainties in measured parameters, the state of a volcano needs to be expressed in probabilistic terms, thus making any rapid assessment sometimes impractical. With the aim of aiding on-duty personnel in volcano-monitoring roles, we present an expert system approach to automatically estimate the ongoing state of a volcano from all available measurements. The system consists of a probabilistic model that encodes the conditional dependencies between measurements and volcanic states in a directed acyclic graph and renders an estimation of the probability distribution of the feasible volcanic states. We test the model with Mount Etna (Italy) as a case study by considering a long record of multivariate data. Results indicate that the proposed model is effective for early warning and has considerable potential for decision-making purposes.},

Material can be injected to high levels in the atmosphere and dispersed on a global scale. Their structure and behavior are controlled by factors such as magmatic composition, the amount and nature of volatile components, rate of magma discharge, and geometry of the source vent. Volcanic plumes have the potential for impacting the Earth's climate by the injection of volcanic aerosols into the stratosphere and reducing the solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface. Collapsing plumes generate hot mixtures of gases and particles that move down the slopes of a volcano at high speeds and can result in severe volcanic hazard. Significant progress has been made in the modeling of the structure and evolution of plumes as they interact with the atmosphere, and in the tracking of plumes by remote sensing techniques once they disperse downwind from source.},

Mitigation of future volcanic hazards requires adequate warning of a pending eruption, which, in turn, requires detailed understanding of the fundamental processes driving volcanic activity. In this Review, we discuss the processes leading up to volcanic eruptions, by following the journey of magma from crustal storage zones to the surface. Magma reservoirs can feed volcanic eruptions if they contain sufficiently hot and mobile magma and are able to supply sufficient energy for the magma to reach the surface. Young volcanic plumbing systems favour volcanic activity, whereas storage becomes more likely in mature volcanic systems with large reservoirs (hundreds of cubic kilometres). Anticipating volcanic activity requires a multidisciplinary approach, as real-time monitoring and geophysical surveys must be combined with petrology and the eruptive history to understand the temporal evolution of volcanic systems over geological timescales. Numerical modelling serves to link different observational timescales, and the inversion of data sets with physics-based statistical approaches is a promising way forward to advance our understanding of the processes controlling recurrence rate and magnitude of volcanic eruptions.},

The analysis is carried out using the theory of non-linear dynamical systems and the delayed coordinates phase-space reconstruction. Several methods are presented and discussed in order to analyse volcanic tremor data in this framework; finally the time evolution of the computed parameters, both in the long term and close in time to paroxysmal phases, is presented and discussed. Evidence for a strong deterministic component in the dynamics of the volcano is shown.},

The SOM approach allows an automatic pattern recognition, virtually independent from a priori knowledge. Volcanic tremor spectra are randomly presented to the network in a competitive iterative training process, followed by a hierarchical clusterization of the SOM nodes. Spectra are then projected, ordered by time, to clusters on the map. A coherent time evolution of the data through the clusters can highlight the existence of different regimes and the transitions between them. Two Ruapehu events were examined: a phreatic event on 4 October 2006 which displaced the crater lake producing a 4. m high wave on the lake edge, and the more energetic 25 September 2007 phreatic eruption. The SOM analysis provides a classification of tremor spectral patterns that clusters into three regimes that we label by colours. The pattern for both eruptions is consistent with a pre-eruption spectral pattern including enhanced spectral energy in the range of 4 to 6. Hz - labelled 'green tremor'. This gives way to spectra having broader energy between 2 and 6. Hz, the so called 'red tremor' just prior to the eruption. The post eruption pattern includes spectral peaks at generally lower frequencies of 2 to 4. Hz - the so called 'blue tremor'. Clusterization into only three groups yields highly non-unique solutions which cannot explain the variety of processes operating at Ruapehu over long time periods. Regardless, the approach highlights noteworthy similarities that may be explained by a pattern of slow pressurisation under a hydrothermal or magmatic seal - 'green' - followed by seal failure - 'red' - and subsequent de-pressurisation - 'blue' - for the two events studied. Although the application shown here is limited, we think it demonstrates the power of this classification approach. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A volcano can be considered as a dynamical system, and each time series recorded at a volcano can be interpreted as one of its observables. It is therefore theoretically possible to extract, even from a single time series, information about the underlying governing system. This is done through a procedure called ``embedding'' that is based on the intuitive statement that the only time series available carries with it information also about the time evolution of other parameters that we are not able to sample or observe. Carrying out this embedding procedure requires estimates of key parameters such as the optimal delay time and a proper embedding dimension. Other independent but often conceptually similar procedures allow decompositions of the time series into components that may in turn be associated to different source processes. The key to the characterization of volcanic regimes is a process of data reduction, aimed at parsing the amount of data into its most useful components which can then facilitate the interpretation of the system. The approaches presented here can be used to conduct such a data reduction phase, and the reduced data stream can be used not only for characterizing different volcanic regimes but also for determining transitions between them, examining their relationship with external or internal events such as tectonic or volcano-tectonic seismic events, looking for precursors of paroxysmal eruptive phases etc. These results can become additional inputs for physical models in order to understand in detail the physical changes that occurred in the volcanic system and their possible consequences. In this paper, the existing literature on this subject will be reviewed and the prospects of future research will be discussed.},

Few volcano-tectonic events appear superimposed to the continuous hydrothermal tremor. The continuous data indicate variable shallow processes most likely related with variations in temperature and degassing processes within the shallow geothermal system. This alternation of low and high regimes shows significant similarities with other volcanic systems of different nature, although at Dallol the transition is more evident in the thermal than in the seismic and acoustic data.},

  abstract = {A volcano is a complex system, and the characterization of its state at any given time is not an easy task. Monitoring data can be used to estimate the probability of an unrest and/or an eruption episode. These can include seismic, magnetic, electromagnetic, deformation, infrasonic, thermal, geochemical data or, in an ideal situation, a combination of them. Merging data of different origins is a non-trivial task, and often even extracting few relevant and information-rich parameters from a homogeneous time series is already challenging. The key to the characterization of volcanic regimes is in fact a process of data reduction that should produce a relatively small vector of features. The next step is the interpretation of the resulting features, through the recognition of similar vectors and for example, their association to a given state of the volcano. This can lead in turn to highlight possible precursors of unrests and eruptions. This final step can benefit from the application of machine learning techniques, that are able to process big data in an efficient way. Other applications of machine learning in volcanology include the analysis and classification of geological, geochemical and petrological ``static'' data to infer for example, the possible source and mechanism of observed deposits, the analysis of satellite imagery to quickly classify vast regions difficult to investigate on the ground or, again, to detect changes that could indicate an unrest. Moreover, the use of machine learning is gaining importance in other areas of volcanology, not only for monitoring purposes but for differentiating particular geochemical patterns, stratigraphic issues, differentiating morphological patterns of volcanic edifices, or to assess spatial distribution of volcanoes. Machine learning is helpful in the discrimination of magmatic complexes, in distinguishing tectonic settings of volcanic rocks, in the evaluation of correlations of volcanic units, being particularly helpful in tephrochronology, etc. In this chapter we will review the relevant methods and results published in the last decades using machine learning in volcanology, both with respect to the choice of the optimal feature vectors and to their subsequent classification, taking into account both the unsupervised and the supervised approaches.},

  abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

  abstract = {Shallow magma chambers either erupt as volcanoes or solidify as intrusive magma bodies. These magma bodies are traditionally considered to be long-lived and dominated by melt. Cashman et al. review the evidence that shallow magma chambers are actually assembled quickly from much larger, crystal-rich transcrustal magmatic systems. This paradigm helps explain many geophysical and geochemical features of volcanic systems. It also presents challenges for understanding the evolution of magma and provides insight into how and why volcanoes erupt.Science, this issue p. eaag3055BACKGROUNDFor more than 100 years, the melt-dominated magma chamber has been central to conceptual models of volcanism and igneous processes. Over the past few decades, however, emerging evidence is proving enigmatic, puzzling, or inconsistent with this paradigm. At the same time, physical models of igneous processes suggest that magma chambers are surprisingly difficult to form and maintain. The consequence has been an increasing emphasis on igneous processes involving a magma chamber that occupies only the top of a much larger magmatic system; this system extends through the crust, is largely crystalline, and comprises melt, crystals, and exsolved volatiles that are heterogeneously distributed in space and time.ADVANCESNew conceptual models of transcrustal magmatic systems raise new questions about the development and stability of these complex systems and the processes that control their chemical and physical evolution. Over long times, magmatic processes are modulated by slow (plate rate) melt generation and transfer to the lower crust; these slow processes contrast with volcanic eruptions, where large amounts of magma are erupted quickly. The end results of these slow and fast processes are a diverse suite of igneous rocks and a wide spectrum of eruptive behaviors observed in the world's volcanoes.We infer that igneous processes differ substantially in the lower and upper crust. Thermal and rheological conditions in the hot lower crust allow extensive and rapid melt segregation and fractionation. At shallower levels in the crust, by contrast, high rates of melt transfer are required to maintain melt-dominated magma bodies, but long-lived cooler, noneruptible crystal mushes can easily develop. Percolative melt transfer is a major mechanism for creating melt-rich regions and for the chemical evolution of the magmatic system. Upward-moving melt is chemically reactive, causing geochemical variations that are not captured by mathematical descriptions of end-member fractional or equilibrium crystallization. As a consequence, the tools used to interpret geochemical variations in igneous rocks may be ill suited to understanding the processes that created them. Important for the physical evolution of magmatic systems are threshold behaviors that control transitions from slow melt accumulation to rapid melt transfer. Melt-rich segregations, in particular, are inherently unstable and can move through regions of mush. This process may be rapid if melt is redistributed from multiple vertically stacked lenses within a mush into a single magma chamber.OUTLOOKThese new views of magmatic systems have great explanatory power, but require new conceptual models for addressing questions related to magma evolution and the behavior of volcanic systems. Connecting processes throughout the entire transcrustal magmatic system should allow us to (i) relate physical processes of crystal-melt-fluid segregation to magmatic differentiation, (ii) anticipate interactions between melts and fluids generated and stored at different depths, and (iii) determine the physical mechanisms by which magma and associated fluids move through the crust, accumulate in shallow chambers, and then erupt.Major explosive eruption at Cordon Calle, Chile, on 4 June 2011.The underlying causes of violent volcanic eruptions after long periods of dormancy remain a fundamental question.Photo credit: D. Basualto, Southern Andes Volcano Observatory (OVDAS), Sernageomin, ChileVolcanoes are an expression of their underlying magmatic systems. Over the past three decades, the classical focus on upper crustal magma chambers has expanded to consider magmatic processes throughout the crust. A transcrustal perspective must balance slow (plate tectonic) rates of melt generation and segregation in the lower crust with new evidence for rapid melt accumulation in the upper crust before many volcanic eruptions. Reconciling these observations is engendering active debate about the physical state, spatial distribution, and longevity of melt in the crust. Here we review evidence for transcrustal magmatic systems and highlight physical processes that might affect the growth and stability of melt-rich layers, focusing particularly on conditions that cause them to destabilize, ascend, and accumulate in voluminous but ephemeral shallow magma chambers.},

The method exploits the structure of conditional probabilities of a target node given the evidence. First, the set of parameters which is relevant to the calculation of the conditional probabilities of the target node is identified. Next, this set is reduced by removing those combinations of the parameters which either contradict the available evidence or are incompatible. Finally, using the canonical components associated with the resulting subset of parameters, the desired conditional probabilities are obtained. In this way, an important saving in the calculations is achieved. The proposed method can also be used to compute exact upper and lower bounds for the conditional probabilities, hence a sensitivity analysis can be easily performed. Examples are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of volcanic eruptions do not expel magma at the Earth's surface. Although less known than magmatic eruptions, gas-driven eruptions expel fragments of preexisting rocks, volcanic gases, and steam, causing substantial casualties. The destructive potential of these eruptions lies in the difficulty in identifying clear warning signals. Some gas-driven eruptions have been preceded by some physicochemical changes, but these were extremely short-term (from minutes to hours), and no long-term trends have been clearly evidenced so far. Here, we show that unheralded gas-driven eruptions can be forecast in the long term using seismic signals recorded at nearby active craters. In particular, we have found that the most recent gas-driven eruptions at Kawah Ijen (Indonesia) and Ruapehu and Tongariro (New Zealand) volcanoes were all preceded by a systematic relative increase in lower-frequency (4.5-8 Hz) seismic amplitude compared to higher frequencies (8-16 Hz) over time scales of months to years. We show that this precursory activity reflects significant increases in seismic attenua-tion affecting preferentially high-frequency travelling waves; this probably results from the accumulation of volatiles in the shallow crust, which increases pore pressure in small-scale rock heterogeneities and eventually leads to gas-driven eruptions. Our results highlight the feasibility of better constraining the onset and the end of an unrest episode, which is of paramount importance for agencies in charge of volcano monitoring.}

  abstract = {We present the earthquake early warning display (EEWD), an effort to build a free and open-source software to display earthquake early warning (EEW) information. The EEWD design and development builds on the experience of the Swiss Seismological Service at ETH Zurich in running the ShakeAlert UserDisplay developed by Caltech in California. The EEWD is a client-side end-user software capable of (1) supporting alerts generated by the main EEW algorithms used in Europe, starting with the Virtual Seismologist and the PRobabilistic and Evolutionary early warning SysTem (PRESTo); (2) allowing configuration for regionalization of shaking parameter predictions, such as local ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs), ground-motion intensity conversion equations (GMICEs), and amplification due to local site effects; and (3) supporting future developments for configuration according to particular end-user requirements. In addition to real-time operations, the EEWD can replay recorded real-time earthquake alerts and play scenarios. The EEWD, including its source code, is freely distributed to the community of interested users, who are also welcome to contribute to further developments, in particular to the inclusion of custom GMPEs, GMICEs, and intensity prediction equations.},

Based on our experience in the project REAKT, we present a methodological framework to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of using earthquake early warning (EEW) and operational earthquake forecasting (OEF) for real-time mitigation of seismic risk at nuclear facilities. We focus on evaluating the reliability, significance and usefulness of the aforementioned real-time risk-mitigation tools and on the communication of real-time earthquake information to end-users. We find that EEW and OEF have significant potential for the reduction of seismic risk at nuclear plants, although much scientific research and testing is still necessary to optimise their operation for these sensitive and highly-regulated facilities. While our test bed was Switzerland, the methodology presented here is of general interest to the community of EEW researchers and end-users and its scope is significantly beyond its specific application within REAKT.},

In its basic iterative form the method produces an ensemble of solutions which lie in the linear span of the initial ensemble. Choice of the parameterization of the unknown field is thus a key component of the success of the method. We demonstrate how both geometric ideas and hierarchical ideas can be used to design effective parameterizations for a number of applied inverse problems arising in electrical impedance tomography, groundwater flow and source inversion. In particular we show how geometric ideas, including the level set method, can be used to reconstruct piecewise continuous fields, and we show how hierarchical methods can be used to learn key parameters in continuous fields, such as length-scales, resulting in improved reconstructions. Geometric and hierarchical ideas are combined in the level set method to find piecewise constant reconstructions with interfaces of unknown topology.},

One example is a visualization of a surface-wave dispersion data set, another presents a view of three-component seismograms, and two illustrate methods to explore a 3D seismic-velocity model. Unlike other 3D visualization packages, our visualization approach has a minimum requirement on users and is relatively easy to develop, provided you have reasonable programming skills. Utilizing familiar web browsing interfaces, the dynamic tools provide us an effective and efficient approach to explore large data sets and models.}

For complexity analyses, as the wavelet transform have the functions to compress data, filter noise, and maintain the basic form of time series, the MPAV algorithm, while maintaining the accuracy of the algorithm improves the efficiency. As PAV and MPAV algorithms are simple and easy to realize without training, this proposed multi-scale anomaly detection algorithm based on infrequent pattern of time series can therefore be proved to be very useful for computer science applications. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The use of the ensemble smoother (ES) instead of the ensemble Kalman filter increases the nonlinearity of the update step during data assimilation and the need for iterative assimilation methods. A previous version of the iterative ensemble smoother based on Gauss-Newton formulation was able to match data relatively well but only after a large number of iterations. A multiple data assimilation method (MDA) was generally more efficient for large problems but lacked ability to continue "iterating" if the data mismatch was too large. In this paper, we develop an efficient, iterative ensemble smoother algorithm based on the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method of regularizing the update direction and choosing the step length. The incorporation of the LM damping parameter reduces the tendency to add model roughness at early iterations when the update step is highly nonlinear, as it often is when all data are assimilated simultaneously. In addition, the ensemble approximation of the Hessian is modified in a way that simplifies computation and increases stability. We also report on a simplified algorithm in which the model mismatch term in the updating equation is neglected. We thoroughly evaluated the new algorithm based on the modified LM method, LM-ensemble randomized maximum likelihood (LM-EnRML), and the simplified version of the algorithm, LM-EnRML (approx), on three test cases. The first is a highly nonlinear single-variable problem for which results can be compared against the true conditional pdf. The second test case is a one-dimensional two-phase flow problem in which the permeability of 31 grid cells is uncertain. In this case, Markov chain Monte Carlo results are available for comparison with ensemble-based results. The third test case is the Brugge benchmark case with both 10 and 20 years of history. The efficiency and quality of results of the new algorithms were compared with the standard ES (without iteration), the ensemble-based Gauss-Newton formulation, the standard ensemble-based LM formulation, and the MDA. Because of the high level of nonlinearity, the standard ES performed poorly on all test cases. The MDA often performed well, especially at early iterations where the reduction in data mismatch was quite rapid. The best results, however, were always achieved with the new iterative ensemble smoother algorithms, LM-EnRML and LM-EnRML (approx). ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The package takes advantage of the growing number of Python libraries including Obspy. All the data formats supported by Obspy can be supported within the PhasePApy. The PhasePApy has two subpackages: the PhasePicker and the Associator, aiming to identify phase arrival onsets and associate them to phase types, respectively. The PhasePicker and the Associator can work jointly or separately. Three autopickers are implemented in the PhasePicker subpackage: the frequencyband picker, the Akaike information criteria function derivative picker, and the kurtosis picker. All three autopickers identify picks with the same processing methods but different characteristic functions. The PhasePicker triggers the pick with a dynamic threshold and can declare a pick with false-pick filtering. Also, the PhasePicker identifies a pick polarity and uncertainty for further seismological analysis, such as focal mechanism determination. Two associators are included in the Associator subpackage: the 1D Associator and 3D Associator, which assign phase types to picks that can best fit potential earthquakes by minimizing root mean square (rms) residuals of the misfits in distance and time, respectively. The Associator processes multiple picks from all channels at a seismic station and aggregates them to increase computational efficiencies. Both associators use travel-time look up tables to determine the best estimation of the earthquake location and evaluate the phase type for picks. The PhasePApy package has been used extensively for local and regional earthquakes and can work for active source experiments as well.}

From a mathematical perspective data assimilation leads to Bayesian inference problems which can be formulated in terms of Feynman-Kac formulae. In this paper we focus on the sequential nature of many data assimilation problems and their numerical implementation in form of Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate how sequential data assimilation can be interpreted as time-dependent Markov processes, which is often referred to as the McKean approach to Feynman-Kac formulae. It is shown that the McKean approach has very natural links to coupling of random variables and optimal transportation. This link allows one to propose novel sequential Monte Carlo methods/particle filters. In combination with localization these novel algorithms have the potential of beating the curse of dimensionality, which has prevented particle filters from being applied to spatially extended systems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques for fluid flow modelling have gained significant attention in recent years. Advanced deep learning techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. However, most of existing researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows (Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid model based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions. In deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted into the low-dimensional ``latent'' representations. The complex features of flow dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid model enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while maintaining a high computational efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is illustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with different incoming waves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the DCGAN are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model (Fluidity). The spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately. In addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced by five orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations. The promising results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.},

In order to explore geothermal relations between Lake Kuttara and the geothermal area, the heat budget of a hydrothermal pond, Okunoyu, was evaluated, and the heat storage change in the lower layer of Lake Kuttara was calculated by monitoring the water temperature at the deepest point. The lake water temperature consistently increased during the thermal stratification in June\&ndash;November of 2013\&ndash;2016. The heat flux QB at lake bottom was then calculated at a range of 4.1\&ndash;10.9 W/m2, which is probably due to the leakage from a hydrothermal reservoir below the lake bottom. Meanwhile, the heat flux HGin by geothermal groundwater input in Okunoyu was evaluated at 3.5\&ndash;8.5 kW/m2, which is rapidly supplied through faults from underlying hydrothermal reservoirs. With a time lag of 5 months to monthly mean QB values in Lake Kuttara, the correlation with monthly mean HGin in Okunoyu was significant (R2 = 0.586; p \&lt; 0.01). Applying Darcy\&rsquo;s law to the leakage from the hydrothermal reservoir at 260\&ndash;310 m below the lake bottom, the time needed for groundwater\&rsquo;s passage through the media 260\&ndash;310 m thick was evaluated at 148\&ndash;149 days (ca. 5 months). These findings suggest that the hydrothermal reservoir below lake bottom and the underlying hydrothermal reservoirs in the western geothermal area are both connected to a unique geothermal source in the deeper zone as a geothermal flow system of Kuttara Volcano.},

  abstract = {This paper is a pragmatic tutorial review of the cepstrum literature focusing on data processing. The power, complex, and phase cepstra are shown to be easily related to one another. Problems associated with phase unwrapping, linear phase components, spectrum notching, aliasing, oversampling, and extending the data sequence with zeros are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of windowing the sampled data sequence, the log spectrum, and the complex cepstrum are presented. The influence of noise upon the data processing procedures is discussed throughout the paper, but is not thoroughly analyzed. The effects of various forms of liftering the cepstrum are described. The results obtained by applying whitening and trend removal techniques to the spectrum prior to the calculation of the cepstrum are discussed. We have attempted to synthesize the results, procedures, and information peculiar to the many fields that are finding cepstrum analysis useful. In particular we discuss the interpretation and processing of data in such areas as speech, seismology, and hydroacoustics. But we must caution the reader that the paper is heavily influenced by our own experiences; specific procedures that have been found useful in one field should not be considered as totally general to other fields. It is hoped that this review will be of value to those familiar with the field and reduce the time required for those wishing to become so.

  abstract = {Speaker recognition in mismatched condition is a vital issue in the recent years as training and testing speech data can be distorted due various practical conditions. Filter bank based cepstral features are used in many speech, speaker and language recognition tasks. These filter banks are mainly designed according to auditory based principles of speech processing, with variation in shape of filters and localization of their frequencies (center, left and right). The set of band pass filters can capture the information related to human vocal tract, which is one of the main distinguishing characteristics of individual. The non-uniform nature of (such as mel-scale warped) filter bank may cause loss of information in high frequency bands, which may carry some speaker specific information. Therefore uniformly (linearly) spaced filter bank cepstral coefficients can capture better speaker specific information, especially in mismatched conditions. In this paper, cepstral features derived from known psycho-acoustic filter banks (called MFCCs and BFCCs,) are compared with uniformly spaced filter bank cepstral coefficients (UFCCs) for text-dependent and text-independent cases. Experimental results shows that BFCCs are better in text-dependent case, whereas UFCC features give improved results than conventional MFCCs in case of text independent case, in mismatch condition. Results indicate that nature of filter bank plays an important role in extracting the speaker relevant features.},

  abstract = {A dangerous block-ash eruption occurred without warning from Ruapehu Crater Lake on 25 September 2007, ending a 6month period of temperature decline in the lake. The northerly-directed blast sent ballistics of up to 2m diameter more than 2km from the source. The ejecta comprised a variety of volcano-lacustrine lithologies, many showing evidence of intense hydrothermal alteration. Petrographic studies of the ballistics reveal numerous examples of pores/vesicles being filled with assemblages of elemental sulphur, anhydrite, pyrite and natroalunite, and many ballistics exuded liquid sulphur from their pores during cooling at atmospheric pressure. Up to 5\% of the ash was comprised of fine-grained, juvenile glass material, confirming the presence of magma in the shallow vent environment. A long-recognised characteristic of this volcano is the thermal cycling behaviour of the Crater Lake, behaviour which has remained effectively unchanged through two magmatic eruption events in 1945 and in 1995/96. Airborne measurements of CO2 and SO2 flux from the volcano since 2003 show a strong, positive correspondence with temperature cycling in the lake, pointing to a definitive link between heat and mass discharge through the system. Low SO2 emission rates and C/S mole ratios {$>$}30 were typical of the period 2003 to early 2007, and appear to reflect vigorous scrubbing of S gases in the hydrothermal system during this time. To better understand the chemical and physical processes operating in this very dynamic volcanic-hydrothermal system, and its propensity to develop potentially dangerous hydrothermal seals, we have developed an integrated finite-difference (TOUGH2) heat\textendash mass transport simulation of the hydrothermal environment. The model, which is constrained by observed heat and mass flux characteristics of the volcano, demonstrates the transient nature of the heating cycles on the vent/lake system. Of particular interest is the role of CO2 as a relatively inert, pressure-transmitting medium in the hydrothermal environment. Seal formation was simulated using the reactive transport code X1t, which showed that condensation of magmatic vapour into a highly porous medium of andesitic composition leads to rapid formation of an elemental sulphur\textendash anhydrite\textendash natroalunite mineral assemblage, and a drastic reduction in permeability. We suggest that since the 1995/96 vent-clearing eruptions, a shroud of elemental sulphur and other alteration phases formed along the margins of the 2-phase liquid\textendash vapour region enclosing the conduit. This effectively seals the upper portion of the vent from the adjacent, hydrostatically controlled environment, and allows for development of pressurised, vapour-static gas columns beneath the northern and central vents.},

We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy ofSVMs, which we review. Results ofsome experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

  abstract = {Temporal variations in the elastic behaviour of the Earth's crust can be monitored through the analysis of the Earth's seismic response and its evolution with time. This kind of analysis is particularly interesting when combined with the reconstruction of seismic Green's functions from the cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise, which circumvents the limitations imposed by a dependence on the occurrence of seismic events. In fact, because seismic noise is recorded continuously and does not depend on earthquake sources, these cross-correlation functions can be considered analogously to records from continuously repeating doublet sources placed at each station, and can be used to extract observations of variations in seismic velocities. These variations, however, are typically very small: of the order of 0.1 per cent. Such accuracy can be only achieved through the analysis of the full reconstructed waveforms, including later scattered arrivals. We focus on the method known as Moving-Window Cross-Spectral Analysis that has the advantage of operating in the frequency domain, where the bandwidth of coherent signal in the correlation function can be clearly defined. We investigate the sensitivity of this method by applying it to microseismic noise cross-correlations which have been perturbed by small synthetic velocity variations and which have been randomly contaminated. We propose threshold signal-to-noise ratios above which these perturbations can be reliably observed. Such values are a proxy for cross-correlation convergence, and so can be used as a guideline when determining the length of microseismic noise records that are required before they can be used for monitoring with the moving-window cross-spectral technique. \textcopyright{} 2011 Institute de physique du Globe de Paris Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2011 RAS.},

In investigating the relation between fluids and seismic signals, we record acoustic emissions (AEs) in the laboratory that result from fracturing and fluid depressurization through the fractured rock. We vary the fluid viscosity to create field analogues of hydrothermal and magmatic fluids. While fracturing causes high-frequency volcano-tectonic (VT)\textendash type AE signals, fluid venting results in VT and long-period AEs with variable but overall lower dominant frequencies. The viscosity of the vented fluid correlates (1) inversely with the peak dominant frequency, (2) inversely with the number of induced AEs, (3) proportionally to the onset time of AEs, and (4) inversely with the initial rate of AE generation. Tremor was observed only in the early stages of low-viscosity fluid venting and thus may be more associated with gases and hydrothermal fluids than with magma.},

The key element of the method is the real-time, simultaneous measurement of initial peak displacement (Pd) and period parameter (TAUc) for a 3-second window after the first P-arrival time at accelerometer stations located at increasing distances from the epicenter. As for the on-site approach the recorded values of Pd and TAUc are compared to threshold values, which are set for a minimum magnitude Mw 6 and instrumental intensity Imm VII, according to empirical regression analysis of strong motion data from different seismic regions. At each recording site the alert level is assigned based on a decisional table with four entries defined by critical values of the parameters Pd and TAUc. A regional network of stations provides the event location and transmits the information about the alert levels recorded at near-source stations to more distant sites, before the arrival of the most destructive phase. We present the results of performance tests of this method using ten, Mw {$>$} 6 Japanese earthquakes, and propose a very robust methodology for mapping the PDZ in the first seconds after a moderate-to-large earthquake.

Distinct models have been proposed, and whether the magnitude can be predicted while the rupture is ongoing represents an unsolved question. Here we show that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement with time is informative regarding the early stage of the rupture process and can be used as a proxy for the final size of the rupture. For the analysed earthquake set, we found a rapid initial increase of the peak displacement for small events and a slower growth for large earthquakes. Our results indicate that earthquakes occurring in a region with a large critical slip distance have a greater likelihood of growing into a large rupture than those originating in a region with a smaller slip-weakening distance.},

  abstract = {Anticipating the size of the next volcanic eruption in long-term forecasts is a major problem in both basic and applied volcanology. In this study, we investigate the extent to which eruption size is predictable based on historical and other attribute data. Data from the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program (GVP) Catalog is used to determine the predictability of volcanic eruption size as quantified through the reported VEI (Volcano Explosivity Index). The numerical and categorical attributes from the global volcanic catalog were classified with trained random forest and simple prediction models to make a forecast of VEI that can be tested against the most recent eruption of each volcano. We compare these results to two different baseline predictability levels by: (a) selecting randomly from the global distribution of VEIs for the most recent eruptions to calculate a cohort baseline and (b) selecting the most frequent VEI for a given population to calculate a zero-rule baseline. We found that: (1) nearly any method that incorporates prior information on a specific volcano improves the prediction accuracy of the succeeding eruption VEI by at least 10 percentage points relative to the cohort baseline case, (2) incorporating attributes beyond previous VEIs can provide better accuracy and achieve up to 30 percentage point accuracy gains, (3) total accuracy of the VEI forecasting by these methods can be up to nearly 80\% and (4) the zero-rule is an effective prediction method that is modestly outperformed (\textasciitilde\,5 percentage point gain) by random forest methods with multiple attributes on most datasets. We find no notable preference in accuracy based on volcano type. The results quantify the importance of volcano-specific information in long-term forecasting and may help practitioners assess their expected performance when anticipating future eruption size.},

Its persistently high activity during the past decade is characterized by strong degassing and almost annual VEI 1\textendash 2 explosions, which present a threat to the local communities. Following an eruption on 8 September 2012, the intervals between eruptions decreased significantly, which we interpret as the start of a new eruptive phase. We present here the results of semi-continuous SO2 flux measurements covering a period of 18~months, obtained by two scanning UV-DOAS instruments installed as a part of the network for observation of volcanic and atmospheric change project, and the results of real-time seismic amplitude measurements (RSAM) data. Our data comprise a series of small to moderately explosive events in December 2012, June 2013 and February 2014, which were accompanied by increased gas emissions and seismicity. In order to approach an early warning strategy, we present a statistical method for the joint analysis of gas flux and seismic data, by using continuous wavelet transform and cross-wavelet transform (XWT) methods. This analysis shows that the XWT coefficients of SO2 flux and RSAM are in good agreement with the occurrence of eruptive events and thus may be used to indicate magma ascent into the volcano edifice. Such multi-parameter surveillance efforts can be useful for the interpretation and surveillance of possible eruptive events and could thus be used by local institutions for the prediction of upcoming volcanic unrest.},

This bell should be very large, of peculiar sound, and known to everybody as the earthquake bell. Of course nothing but the distant undulation of the surface of the earth should ring it. This machinery would be self-acting, and not dependent on the telegraph operators, who might not always retain presence of mind enough to telegraph at the moment, or might sound the alarm too often. As some shocks appear to come from the west, a cable might be laid to the Farallon Islands, 25 miles distant, and warnings thus given of any danger from that direction. Of course there might be shocks, the central force of which was too near this city to be thus protected, but that is not likely to occur once in a hundred times.}

This system is solved with pressure and enthalpy as the primary variables to increase stability of phase transition between single and two-phase states.

EEW systems consist of seismic networks and mathematical models/algorithms capable of real-time data telemetry that alert stakeholders (e.g., civil-protection authorities, the public), to an earthquake's nucleation seconds to minutes before strong shaking occurs at target sites. During this time, actions can be taken to significantly decrease detrimental impacts. We investigate distributions of EEW warning times available across various parts of the EuroMediterranean region, based on seismicity models and seismic network density. We then determine the risk-reduction potential of these times, by defining their spatial relationship with exposure, event-dependent vulnerability, and an alert accuracy proxy, using well-established risk-prediction tools from earthquake engineering. The results are quantitative EEW feasibility maps, which demonstrate that EEW could be an effective risk-mitigation tool for a significant portion of Europe.},

  abstract = {Earthquake early warning (EEW) is a relatively new strategy for reducing disaster risk and increasing resilience to seismic hazard in urban settings. EEW systems provide real-time information about ongoing earthquakes, enabling individuals, communities, governments, businesses and others located at distance to take timely action to reduce the probability of harm or loss before the earthquake-induced ground shaking reaches them. Examples of potential losses mitigated by EEW systems include injuries and infrastructure downtime. These systems are currently operating in nine countries, and are being/have been tested for implementation in 13 more. This paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to EEW around the world. We specifically focus on the various algorithms that have been developed for the rapid calculation of seismic-source parameters, ground shaking, and potential consequences in the wake of an event. We also discuss limitations of the existing applied methodologies, with a particular emphasis on the lack of engineering-related (i.e., risk and resilience) metrics currently used to support decision-making related to the triggering of alerts by various end users. Finally, we provide a number of suggestions for future end-user-orientated advances in the field of EEW. For example, we propose that next-generation EEW systems should incorporate engineering-based, application-specific models/tools for more effective risk communication. They should operate within robust probabilistic frameworks that explicitly quantify uncertainties at each stage of the analysis, for more informed stakeholder decision-making. These types of advancements in EEW systems would represent an important paradigm shift in current approaches to issuing early warnings for natural hazards.},

The database is publically available online at http://www.bgs.ac.uk/vogripaand currently contains information on nearly 3,000 volcanoes and over 1,800 Quaternary eruption records. Not all volcanoes currently have eruptions associated with them but have been included to allow for easy expansion of the database as more data are found. Data fields include: magnitude, Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), deposit volumes, eruption dates, and rock type. The scientific community is invited to contribute new data and also alert the database manager to potentially incorrect data. Whilst the database currently focuses only on large magnitude eruptions, it will be expanded to include data specifically relating to the principal volcanic hazards (e.g. pyroclastic flows, tephra fall, lahars, debris avalanches, ballistics), as well as vulnerability (e.g. population figures, building type) to facilitate risk assessments of future eruptions.},

In recent years, the number of different phases used in analysis has been growing, as has the availability of new Earth models, especially models developed from detailed regional studies. These factors highlight the need for versatile utilities that allow the calculation of travel times and ray paths of (ideally) any conceivable seismic phase passing through (ideally) arbitrary velocity models. The method of Buland and Chapman (1983) provides significant progress toward this need by allowing for the computation of times and paths of any rays passing through arbitrary spherically symmetric velocity models. The implementation of this method through the ttimes software program (Kennett and Engdahl, 1991) for a limited number of velocity models and a standard set of seismic phases has been widely...}

The addition of the low-frequency component allows rapid distinction of earthquake size for large magnitude events with high precision, unlike accelerometer data that saturate for earthquakes greater than M 7 to 8, and is available well before the coseismic displacements are emplaced. These results, though based on a limited seismogeodetic data set, support earlier studies that propose it may be possible to estimate the final magnitude of an earthquake well before the rupture is complete.},

  abstract = {The development of Virtual Seismologist (VS) method for seismic early warning is the topic of this chapter. Each of Chapters 5 through 8 is a case study of the VS method applied to the data set of a real Southern California earthquake. The Virtual Seismologist method is a Bayesian approach to seismic early warning inspired by the relative speed and accuracy with which expert seismologists can estimate magnitude and distance by combining their "background" knowledge of earthquake activity with quick visual analysis of available waveform data. From the shape and relative frequency content of incoming data, expert seismologists are typically able to estimate quickly the magnitude and location of earthquakes. Part of this can be attributed to the experience that (presumably) an expert seismologist would have in analyzing waveform data. However, experience in analyzing waveform data is not the only factor that contributes to the speed and relative accuracy of human seismol-ogists in estimating earthquake source parameters. That is, estimating earthquake source parameters from limited data is not merely a pattern recognition problem (though it may largely be one). A "background" knowledge regarding relative earthquake probabilities is an essential component of how human seismologists process information. Knowledge of fault locations, relative frequency of earthquake magnitudes (Gutenberg-Richter law), spatial and temporal changes in observed seismicity, ongoing earthquake sequences, and the state of health of the seismic network monitoring the earthquake activity are some of the disparate types of information relevant to the source estimation problem. The Virtual Seismologist method for seismic early warning uses Bayes' theorem to combine pattern recognition-type approaches on the}

  abstract = {Cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise recorded by a pair of stations is now commonly recognized to contain the Green's function between the stations. Although traveltimes extracted from such data have been extensively used to get images of the Earth interior, very few studies have attempted to exploit the amplitudes. In this work, we investigate the information contained in the amplitudes and we probe the capability of noise correlations to recover anelastic attenuation. To do so, we carry out numerical experiments in which we generate seismic noise at the surface of a 1-D Earth model. One of the advantages of our approach is that both uniform and non-uniform distributions of noise sources can be taken into account. In the case of a uniform distribution, we find that geometrical spreading as well as intrinsic attenuation are retrieved, even after strong non-linear operations such as one-bit normalization and spectral whitening applied to the noise recordings. In the case of a non-uniform distribution of sources, the geometrical spreading of the raw noise correlations depends on the distribution, but intrinsic attenuation is preserved. For the one-bit noise and whitened noise correlations, the interpretation of observed amplitude decays requires further study.},

  abstract = {Waveforms emerging from correlations of long seismic noise records are extensively used to investigate the crustal and upper-mantle structure of the Earth. To remove the non-stationary events that inevitably lie in seismic records, the so-called one-bit normalization is commonly applied to the noise data. This processing consists of replacing each sample of a record by its sign. Although it is a strong non-linear operation, it preserves the phase of the signal emerging from correlation. Some recent studies show that information can also be extracted from the amplitude of such correlations. In this paper, we develop a theory to understand these non-intuitive results. A statistical approach is used to get an expression of the one-bit noise correlation. This expression involves the standard deviations of coherent and incoherent noise. These two kinds of noise are precisely defined, and explicit expressions of their standard deviations are given in the case of a uniform distribution of noise sources generating surface waves on a layered half-space. In this case, we show that the one-bit noise correlation has the same phase and relative amplitude as the raw noise correlation. This is true in both elastic and anelastic media. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theory.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of volcanoes is mainly performed by sensors installed on their structures, aiming at recording seismic activities and reporting them to observatories to be later analyzed by specialists. However, due to the high volume of data continuously collected, the use of automatic techniques is an important requirement to support real time analyses. In this sense, a basic but challenging task is the classification of seismic activities to identify signals yielded by different sources as, for instance, the movement of magmatic fluids. Although there exists several approaches proposed to perform such task, they were mainly designed to deal with raw signals. In this paper, we present a 2D approach developed considering two main steps. Firstly, spectrograms for every collected signal are calculated by using Fourier Transform. Secondly, we set a deep neural network to discriminate seismic activities by analyzing the spectrogram shapes. As a consequence, our classifier provided outstanding results with accuracy rate greater than 95\%.},

We illustrate that simple, low-dimensional geometrical concepts that are sometimes used to construct such distributions may become completely distorted (and even untrue) in higher dimensional problems.This has important implications for Bayesian inversion: if a convenient sampling distribution is constructed using low dimensional geometrical concepts which cause it to differ from the distribution representing our prior information, these differences can become extremely expensive to correct in higher dimensions. Indeed, theymaymakea nonlinear inversion computationally intractable when this need not be the case. A crucial factor in Bayesian inversion is, therefore, whether onefirmly believes in a particular prior distribution. If so, this distribution may constitute the most efficient sampling distribution, even in cases where it is not straight- forward to draw samples from that prior distribution. The sampling artifacts described above then become irrelevant since they represent true prior beliefs.},

The first step of the method consists in finding, for each path, a radially stratified upper mantle model compatible with the Love and Rayleigh wave seismograms relative to that path. The fundamental mode and few higher modes are modelled in the waveform inversion. In a second step, the models related to the different paths are used in a tomographic inversion to map the 3-D upper mantle structure. The 3-D velocity model has a lateral resolution of 1000 km. No significant velocity anomalies are found below 300 km, although the resolution is still good. Continental roots are confined to the upper 300 km and low velocities below mid-oceanic ridges to the upper 250 km, depending on their spreading rates. At shallow depths ({$<$}80 km), we find a positive velocity anomaly beneath the West Indian ridge near the Rodriguez triple junction, where gravimetric and bathymetric data indicate a reduced volcanic activity. At greater depth (around 200 km), a low velocity signature is found beneath the hot-spot of R\'eunion-Mauritius islands and the Central Indian ridge. It could reflect a real connection between the two structures.}

The reason for this is not immediately obvious. In the absence of anelastic attenuation and ignoring the effect of the response of the Wood-Anderson seismometer that is inherent in the definition of ML, theory predicts that, assuming constant stress drop and apparent rupture velocity, the relation between ML and ES should be ML = (2=3) log ES + constant. Theoretical considerations and numerical simulations with synthetic moment-rate functions show that, in reality, the influence of anelastic attenuation on ML and on estimates of ES of small earthquakes as well as the effect of the Wood-Anderson response on ML of larger earthquakes lead to the observed scaling relationship. Because of anelastic attenuation, for small earthquakes with magnitudes below a certain threshold all information about the dynamic properties of the source is irrevocably lost. Consequently, both ML and ES are different measures of earthquake strength for these small events than for larger earthquakes.},

All segments from day and night local time windows were included in the calculation without parsing out earthquakes. Noise levels were considerably higher for the Nepal stations than the Tibet stations, in particular, in the high frequencies. The most northern of the stations in Tibet show unexpected day/night differences of [\textasciitilde ]10-20 dB for the vertical components, which is significantly greater than the day/ night differences of the horizontal components. However, all the stations show noise levels concordant with microseism peak levels. Power spectral density estimates show moderate noise levels with all stations falling within the high and low bounds of Peterson (1993), except for the southern Nepal stations, which were built above ground and exceed the high-noise model at frequencies {$>$}1.0 Hz.

  abstract = {We analyze background noise to assess the effects of experimental temporary seismic vault construction and to determine the time needed for noise at sites to stabilize after deployment noise as part of the Himalayan Nepal Tibet Seismic Experiment (HIMNT). We calculated power spectral densities of background noise for each component of each broadband seismometer deployed in Nepal and Tibet and then compared them with the high-noise model and low-noise Model of Peterson (1993). All segments from day and night local time windows were included in the calculation without parsing out earthquakes. Noise levels were considerably higher for the Nepal stations than the Tibet stations, in particular, in the high frequencies. The most northern of the stations in Tibet show unexpected day/night differences of {$\sim$}10-20 dB for the vertical components, which is significantly greater than the day/night differences of the horizontal components. However, all the stations show noise levels concordant with microseism peak levels. Power spectral density estimates show moderate noise levels with all stations falling within the high and low bounds of Peterson (1993), except for the southern Nepal stations, which were built above ground and exceed the high-noise model at frequencies {$>$} 1.0 Hz. The time needed for noise at a site to stabilize was {$\sim$}1-5 days after deployment.}

  abstract = {The Seismic Hazard Harmonization in Europe (SHARE) project, which began in June 2009, aims at establishing new standards for probabilistic seismic hazard assessment in the Euro-Mediterranean region. In this context, a logic tree for ground-motion prediction in Europe has been constructed. Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and weights have been determined so that the logic tree captures epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction for six different tectonic regimes in Europe. Here we present the strategy that we adopted to build such a logic tree. This strategy has the particularity of combining two complementary and independent approaches: expert judgment and data testing. A set of six experts was asked to weight pre-selected GMPEs while the ability of these GMPEs to predict available data was evaluated with the method of Scherbaum et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 99:3234\textendash 3247, 2009). Results of both approaches were taken into account to commonly select the smallest set of GMPEs to capture the uncertainty in ground-motion prediction in Europe. For stable continental regions, two models, both from eastern North America, have been selected for shields, and three GMPEs from active shallow crustal regions have been added for continental crust. For subduction zones, four models, all non-European, have been chosen. Finally, for active shallow crustal regions, we selected four models, each of them from a different host region but only two of them were kept for long periods. In most cases, a common agreement has been also reached for the weights. In case of divergence, a sensitivity analysis of the weights on the seismic hazard has been conducted, showing that once the GMPEs have been selected, the associated set of weights has a smaller influence on the hazard.},

Kalman filters estimate the weights of a neural network, considering the weights as a dynamic and upgradable system. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a tool that has been used by many authors for the training of Neural Networks (NN) over the years. However, this filter has some inherent drawbacks such as instability caused by initial conditions due to linearization and costly calculation of the Jacobian matrices. Therefore, the Unscented Kalman Filter variant has been demonstrated by several authors to be superior in terms of convergence, speed and accuracy when compared to the EKF. Training using this algorithm tends to become more precise compared to EKF, due to its linear transformation technique known as the Unscented Transform (UT). The results presented in this study validate the efficiency and accuracy of the Kalman filter variants reported by other authors, with superior performance in non-linear systems when compared with traditional methods. Such approaches are still little explored in the literature.},

However, this technology can be ineffective, because it is sometimes difficult to visualize certain phenomena, and surface roughness can cause shadows. In such instances, manual image selection is required to select images that are suitably illuminated, and in which visibility is adequate. This impedes the development of an autonomous system applied to ICC in monitoring applications. In this paper, the uncertainty introduced by the presence of shadows is quantitatively analysed, and a method suitable for ICC applications is proposed: The method automatically selects images, and is based on a supervised classification of images using the support vector machine. According to visual and illumination conditions, the images are divided into three classes: (i) No visibility, (ii) direct illumination and (iii) diffuse illumination. Images belonging to the diffuse illumination class are used in cross-correlation processing. Finally, an operative procedure is presented for applying the automated ICC processing chain in geoscience monitoring applications.},

We report {$\sim$}300 SO2 flux measurements from 10 volcanoes and gas ratios from 11 volcanoes in Costa Rica and Nicaragua representing the most extensive available assessment of this {$\sim$}500 km arc segment. The SO2 flux from SCAVA is estimated at 6,240 {$\pm$} 1,150 T/d, about a factor of three higher than previous estimations (1972\textendash 2013). We attribute this increase in part to our more complete assessment of the arc. Another consideration in interpreting the difference is the context of increased volcanic activity, as there were more eruptions in 2015\textendash 2016 than in any period since {$\sim$}1980. A potential explanation for increased degassing and volcanic activity is a change in crustal stress regime (from compression to extension, opening volcanic conduits) following two large (Mw {$>$} 7) earthquakes in the region in 2012. The CO2 flux from the arc is estimated at 22,500 {$\pm$} 4,900 T/d, which is equal to or greater than estimates of C input into the SCAVA subduction zone. Time-series data sets for arc degassing need to be improved in temporal and spatial coverage to robustly constrain volatile budgets and tectonic controls. Arc volatile budgets are strongly influenced by short-lived degassing events and arc systems likely display significant short-term variations in volatile output, calling for expansion of nascent geochemical monitoring networks to achieve spatial and temporal coverage similar to traditional geophysical networks.},

Simulations of seismic wave propagation in sedimentary basins capture this effect; however, there exists no method to validate these results for earthquakes that have not yet occurred. We present a new approach for ground motion prediction that uses the ambient seismic field. We apply our method to a suite of magnitude 7 scenario earthquakes on the southern San Andreas fault and compare our ground motion predictions with simulations. Both methods find strong amplification and coupling of source and structure effects, but they predict substantially different shaking patterns across the Los Angeles Basin. The virtual earthquake approach provides a new approach for predicting long-period strong ground motion.},

It is based on similar systems used in North America (NIMS) and Australia (AIIMS). This second edition of CIMS builds upon and replaces the first version that was commonly referred to as the `Blue Book'. It describes how New Zealand agencies use the CIMS framework to coordinate, command, and control incident response of any scale, how the response can be structured, and the relationships between the respective CIMS functions and between the levels of response. It is the primary reference for incident management in New Zealand. For the purpose of CIMS an incident is an occurrence that needs a response from one or more agencies. Most incidents are emergencies, though CIMS may also be used to manage incidents that are not emergencies, such as large public gatherings and events. Incidents range from small to large; simple to complex; and can be managed at one or multiple levels. The CIMS framework is developed by a Steering Group consisting of representatives of all the CIMS stakeholder agencies1 and it is endorsed by the Officials Committee for External and Security Coordination (ODESC). In the future CIMS will be reviewed every five years.},

  abstract = {The Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) straddles the continent-ocean boundary in West Africa but exhibits no clear age progression. This renders it difficult to explain by traditional plume/plate motion hypotheses; thus, there remains no consensus on the processes responsible for its development. To understand better the nature of asthenospheric flow beneath the CVL, and the effects of hotspot tectonism on the overlying lithosphere, we analyze mantle seismic anisotropy and seismicity. Cameroon is relatively aseismic compared to hotspots elsewhere, with little evidence for magmatism-related crustal deformation away from Mount Cameroon, which last erupted in 2000. Low crustal Vp/Vs ratios (1.74) and a lack of evidence for seismically anisotropic aligned melt within the lithosphere both point toward a poorly developed magmatic plumbing system beneath the CVL. Null SKS splitting observations dominate the western continental portion of the CVL; elsewhere, anisotropic fast polarization directions parallel the strike of the Precambrian Central African Shear Zone (CASZ). The nulls may imply that the convecting upper mantle beneath the CVL is isotropic, or characterized by a vertically oriented olivine lattice preferred orientation fabric, perhaps due to a mantle plume or the upward limb of a small-scale convection cell. Precambrian CASZ fossil lithospheric fabrics along the CVL may have been thermomechanically eroded during Gondwana breakup 130Ma, with an isotropic lower lithosphere subsequently reforming due to cooling of the slow-moving African plate. Small-scale lithospheric delamination during the 30Ma recent development of the line may also have contributed to the erosion of the CASZ lithospheric fossil anisotropy, at the same time as generating the low-volume alkaline basaltic volcanism along the CVL. \textcopyright 2014.

Computationally intensive viscoelastic codes must be evaluated at thousands of times and locations, and as a result, studies tend to adopt a few fixed rheological structures and model geometries and examine the predicted time-dependent deformation over short ({$<$}10 years) time periods at a given depth after a large earthquake. Training a deep neural network to learn a computationally efficient representation of viscoelastic solutions, at any time, location, and for a large range of rheological structures, allows these calculations to be done quickly and reliably, with high spatial and temporal resolutions. We demonstrate that this machine learning approach accelerates viscoelastic calculations by more than 50,000\%. This magnitude of acceleration will enable the modeling of geometrically complex faults over thousands of earthquake cycles across wider ranges of model parameters and at larger spatial and temporal scales than have been previously possible.},

  abstract = {How do body-wave traveltimes constrain the Earth's radial (1-D) seismic structure? Existing 1-D seismological models underpin 3-D seismic tomography and earthquake location algorithms. It is therefore crucial to assess the quality of such 1-D models, yet quantifying uncertainties in seismological models is challenging and thus often ignored. Ideally, quality assessment should be an integral part of the inverse method. Our aim in this study is twofold: (i) we show how to solve a general Bayesian non-linear inverse problem and quantify model uncertainties, and (ii) we investigate the constraint on spherically symmetric P-wave velocity (VP) structure provided by body-wave traveltimes from the EHB bulletin (phases Pn, P, PP and PKP). Our approach is based on artificial neural networks, which are very common in pattern recognition problems and can be used to approximate an arbitrary function. We use a Mixture Density Network to obtain 1-D marginal posterior probability density functions (pdfs), which provide a quantitative description of our knowledge on the individual Earth parameters. No linearization or model damping is required, which allows us to infer a model which is constrained purely by the data. We present 1-D marginal posterior pdfs for the 22 VP parameters and seven discontinuity depths in our model. P-wave velocities in the inner core, outer core and lower mantle are resolved well, with standard deviations of \textasciitilde 0.2 to 1 per cent with respect to the mean of the posterior pdfs. The maximum likelihoods of VP are in general similar to the corresponding ak135 values, which lie within one or two standard deviations from the posterior means, thus providing an independent validation of ak135 in this part of the radial model. Conversely, the data contain little or no information on P-wave velocity in the D" layer, the upper mantle and the homogeneous crustal layers. Further, the data do not constrain the depth of the discontinuities in our model. Using additional phases available in the ISC bulletin, such as PcP, PKKP and the converted phases SP and ScP, may enhance the resolvability of these parameters. Finally, we show how the method can be extended to obtain a posterior pdf for a multidimensional model space. This enables us to investigate correlations between model parameters. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2013 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.},

Here, we use data from a dense infrasound network deployed in 2017 on Mt. Etna, Italy, to estimate eruptive volume flow rates (VFRs) during small gas-and-ash explosions. We use a finite-difference time-domain approximation to compute the acoustic Green's functions and perform a full waveform inversion for a multipole source, combining monopole and horizontal dipole terms. The inversion produces realistic estimates of VFR, on the order of 4 \texttimes{} 104 m3/s and well-defined patterns of source directivity. This is the first application of acoustic waveform inversion at Mt. Etna. Our results demonstrate that acoustic waveform inversion is a mature and robust tool for assessment of source parameters and holds potential as a tool to provide rapid estimates of VFR in near real time.},

  abstract = {High-resolution seismic tomography at local and regional scales requires large and consistent sets of arrival-time data. Algorithms combining accurate picking with an automated quality classification can be used for repicking waveforms and compiling large arrival-time data sets suitable for tomographic inversion. S-wave velocities represent a key parameter for petrological interpretation, improved hypocenter determination, as well as for seismic hazard models. In our approach, we combine three commonly used phase detection and picking methods in a robust S-wave picking procedure. Information from the different techniques provides an in situ estimate of timing uncertainty and of the reliability of the automatic phase identification. Automatic picks are compared against manually picked reference picks of selected earthquakes in the Alpine region. The average accuracy of automatic picks and their classification is comparable with the reference picks, although a higher number of picks is downgraded to lower quality classes by the automatic picker. In the production-mode, we apply the picker to a data set of 552 earthquakes in the Alps recorded at epicentral distances {$<$}150 km. The resulting data set includes about 2500 S phases with an upper error bound of 0.27 sec. 10.1785/0120080019},

The whole section on array seismology in that issue of the Manual was no longer than two pages, including one figure; array seismology being at that time more a matter of some specialists rather than a commonly applied technique. During the last two decades, new seismic arrays were installed all over the globe and, due to digital data acquisition systems and digital signal processing, it has become easier to handle the large amount of data from seismic arrays. Therefore, array observations have become more commonly used. This requires a separate Chapter on array seismology in the New Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice, which explains the principles of seismic arrays and how their data can be used to analyze seismic observations. In the following sections we define first the term 'seismic array' and show examples of seismic arrays installed around the world. We then describe the theoretical basics of the processing of seismic data observed with an array, continue with the explanation of helpful tools for automatic analysis of array data and explain how local and regional events are located at the NORSAR Data Processing Center by using single array observations. Finally, we describe some helpful rules and procedures to find the best configuration for a seismic array and present a table of operational and planed seismic arrays.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015, Swiss Geological Society. During 2014, 817 earthquakes and 180 quarry blasts were detected and located in the region under consideration. An additional 160 earthquakes with ML~{$\leq~$}1.0 were located using supplementary analysis techniques. The number of located earthquakes in 2014 was the largest since the installation of a seismic network in Switzerland in 1975. This unusually large number is mainly due to the occurrence of two vigorous earthquake sequences, and the local reduction of the earthquake detection thresholds of the Swiss seismic network. With a total of 22 earthquakes of ML~{$\geq~$}2.5, the seismic activity of larger and potentially felt events was close to the average of 23 earthquakes over the previous 39~years. The most noteworthy seismicity was the earthquake sequence near Diemtigen, west of Lake Thun, where more than 270 events were located between April and December. High-precision hypocenter relocation was applied to image the spatio-temporal evolution of this seismicity. The sequence culminated in an ML3.2 event in October, which was felt in the region of Lake Thun and Bern. Other cases of earthquakes felt by the public include earthquakes in the region of Biel (ML3.2), in Vallorcine (ML3.2), and in Stalden (ML3.0). Finally, a small but unusually deep earthquake was recorded beneath the Jura Mountains. Focal depth, apparent velocities, as well as waveform characteristics of this earthquake are consistent with a source in the uppermost mantle. This earthquake is the first reliable record of a sub-Moho event ever observed in Switzerland. Zusammenfassung: Dieser Bericht des Schweizerischen Erdbebendienstes stellt eine Zusammenfassung der im Vorjahr in der Schweiz und Umgebung aufgetretenen Erdbeben dar. Im Jahr 2014 wurden im erw\"ahnten Gebiet 817 Erdbeben sowie 180 Sprengungen erfasst und lokalisiert. Weitere 160 Beben mit Magnituden ML~{$\leq~$}1.0 wurden mit Hilfe von zus\"atzlichen Auswertungsmethoden lokalisiert. Die Zahl der in 2014 lokalisierten Erdbeben ist die h\"ochste seit der Installation eines seismischen Messnetzes in der Schweiz im Jahre 1975. Diese au\ss ergew\"ohnlich hohe Zahl erkl\"art sich vor allem durch das Auftreten zweier \"au\ss erst aktiver Erdbebensequenzen und der lokalen Absenkung der Detektionsschwelle f\"ur Erdbeben durch die Verbesserung des seismischen Messnetzes der Schweiz. Mit 22 Beben der Magnitude ML~{$\geq~$}2.5 lag die seismische Aktivit\"at von st\"arkeren und potentiell sp\"urbaren Ereignissen im Jahr 2014 nahe am Durchschnitt von 23 Beben pro Jahr der vergangenen 39 Jahren. Bemerkenswert war die Erdbebensequenz von Diemtigen, westlich vom Thunersee bei der mehr als 270 Ereignisse zwischen April und Dezember lokalisiert wurden. Hochaufl\"osende Erdbebenlokalisierung wurde verwendet, um die r\"aumliche und zeitliche Entwicklung dieser Erdbebenserie abzubilden. Ein Beben der Magnitude ML3.2 bildete den H\"ohepunkt der Sequenz im Oktober. Dieses wurde in der Region des Thunersees und Bern deutlich versp\"urt. Weitere Erdbeben, die von der Bev\"olkerung versp\"urt wurden, waren unter anderem die Beben in der Region Biel (ML3.2), in Vallorcine (ML3.2) und in Stalden (ML3.0). Dar\"uberhinaus wurde ein schwaches, aber ungew\"ohnlich tiefes Erdbeben unterhalb des Juras registriert. Sowohl Herdtiefe, Scheingeschwindigkeiten und Charakter der Wellenformen weisen auf einen Erdbebenherd im obersten Mantel hin. Damit ist dieses Ereignis die erste verl\"assliche Beobachtung eines Erdbebens unterhalb der Moho in der Schweiz. Resum\'e: Ce rapport du Service Sismologique Suisse r\'esume l'activit\'e sismique en Suisse et dans ses r\'egions environnantes au cours de l'ann\'ee 2014. Pendant cette p\'eriode, 817 tremblements de terre et 180 tirs de carri\`ere ont \'et\'e d\'etect\'es et localis\'es dans la r\'egion. 160~s\'eismes additionnels de magnitude ML~{$\leq~$}1.0 ont \'et\'e localis\'es \`a l'aide de moyens suppl\'ementaires d'analyse. Le nombre des \'ev\`enements localis\'es en 2014 constitue un record depuis 1975, date de l'installation du r\'eseau sismologique en Suisse. Ce grand nombre inhabituel peut \^etre principalement expliqu\'e par l'occurrence de deux s\'equences sismiques importantes et par la diminution locale des niveaux de d\'etection r\'esultant des am\'eliorations apport\'ees au r\'eseau sismologique suisse. Avec un total de 22~s\'eismes de magnitude ML~{$\geq~$}2.5, le nombre des \'ev\`enements les plus forts et potentiellement ressentis est proche de la moyenne annuelle de 23 tremblements de terre enregistr\'ee pendant les 39 derni\`eres ann\'ees. La sismicit\'e la plus notable est la s\'equence sismique qui a eu lieu pr\`es de Diemtigen, \`a l'ouest du lac de Thoune, o\`u plus de 270 \'ev\`enements ont \'et\'e localis\'es entre avril et d\'ecembre. La relocalisation de grande pr\'ecision des hypocentres a permis d'imager l'\'evolution spatio-temporelle de cette sismicit\'e. La s\'equence est domin\'ee par un s\'eisme de magnitude ML3.2 en octobre qui a \'et\'e ressenti dans la r\'egion du lac de Thoune et \`a Berne. D'autres tremblements de terre ont \'et\'e ressentis par la population, tels que ceux de la r\'egion de Bienne (ML3.2), de Vallorcine (ML3.2) et de Stalden (ML3.0). Enfin, un faible mais inhabituel s\'eisme profond a \'et\'e enregistr\'e dans le Jura. Sa profondeur focale, les vitesses apparentes enregistr\'ees ainsi que les caract\'eristiques des formes d'ondes de ce tremblement de terre sont en accord avec une source dans le manteau sup\'erieur. Par cons\'equence, ce tremblement de terre est le premier enregistrement fiable d'un \'ev\`enement ayant eu lieu sous le Moho en Suisse.},

  abstract = {The essential skills of modeling \textemdash{} abstraction, analysis, simulation, and vali- dation \textemdash{} are central in engineering, natural sciences, social sciences, medicine, and many other fields. Some students learn these skills implicitly, but in most schools they are not taught explicitly, and students get little practice. That's the problem this book is meant to address. At Olin College, we use this book in a class called Modeling and Simulation, which all students take in their first semester. My colleagues, John Geddes and Mark Somerville, and I developed this class and taught it for the first time in 2009. It is based on our belief that modeling should be taught explicitly, early, and throughout the curriculum. It is also based on our conviction that computation is an essential part of this process. If students are limited to the mathematical analysis they can do by hand, they are restricted to a small number of simple physical systems, like a projectile moving in a vacuum or a block on a frictionless plane. And they will only work with bad models; that is, models that are too simple for their intended purpose. In nearly every mechanical system, air resistance and friction are essential features; if we ignore them, our predictions will be wrong and our designs won't work. In most freshman physics classes, students don't make modeling decisions; sometimes they are not even aware of the decisions that have been made for them. Our goal is to teach the entire modeling process and give students a chance to practice it.},

Calculations may be performed sequentially on multiple meteorological grids, going from fine to coarse resolution and using either archive or forecast data fields. Air concentration calculations associate the mass of the pollutant species with the release of either puffs, particles, or a combination of both. The dispersion rate is calculated from the vertical diffusivity profile, wind shear, and horizontal deformation of the wind field. Air concentrations are calculated at a specific grid-point for puffs and as cell-average concentrations for particles. The model results are evaluated against ACE balloon trajectories, air concentrations from the ANATEX tracer experiment, radiological deposition from the Chernobyl accident, and satellite photographs of the Rabaul volcanic eruption. One common feature of the model results was their sensitivity to the vertical atmospheric structure; trajectories in terms of their height when near ground-level due to the strong gradients of wind speed and direction, air concentrations with respect to the rate of vertical mixing, and deposition as a result of the vertical distribution of the pollutant.},

The TPM, along with other hardware, can implement a cloaked computation, whose memory state cannot be observed by any other software, including the operating system and hypervisor. We show that malware can use cloaked computations to hide essential secrets (like the target of an attack) from a malware analyst. We describe and implement a protocol that establishes an encryption key under control of the TPM that can only be used by a specific infection program. An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol. Hardening legitimate uses of the TPM against attack improves the resilience of our malware, creating a Catch-22 for secure computing technology.},

  abstract = {Mount Erebus, Antarctica, has a persistent lava lake with Strombolian eruptions. Volcanic eruptions can be automatically detected with multiple methods such as cross-correlation of seismic recordings and identifying anomalies in gas emissions. We demonstrate a new method of detecting Strombolian eruptions by training a convolutional neural network to automatically categorize eruptions in infrared images obtained from the rim of the crater above the Ray lava lake atop Mount Erebus. Over 9 million images were obtained from previous research (Peters et al., 2014a). The infrared images were shot during a span of over 2 years; one image every 2 s when weather conditions did not hinder the electrical supply. Training was performed with infrared images of the eruptions detected through seismic cross-correlation with a stacked waveform. Eruptions detected using machine learning on infrared images from December 2013 through December 2014 correctly categorized 84\% of the detections as eruptions. The remaining 16\% were caused by effects from the plume confounding the neural network. Nearly all of the eruptions detected utilizing seismic cross-correlation were also categorized correctly by the neural network during periods for which image data was available. We concluded machine learning is an effective method for classifying the characteristics of Strombolian eruptions which further improves the ability to study their origins while assessing the hazards posed by volcanic eruptions.},

  abstract = {The Coalinga earthquake sequence of 1983 provided a unique opportunity to perform a three-dimensional velocity and hypocenter inversion in an area of complex three-dimensional structure dominated by folding and blind thrusts. Additionally, since other varied geological and geophysical studies have been completed in this area, the three-dimensional inversion solution could be compared to other interpretations. Inversion of 7696 P and 1511 S first arrivals from earthquakes and 696 P first arrivals from refraction shots produced a three-dimensional velocity model with grid spacing of 1\textendash 2 km in the hypocentral area. The overall shape and location of velocity features correspond well to the mapped surface geology. The three-dimensional inversion yields details of folds where the resolution is good and the general shape where resolution is lower. The amounts of structural relief inferred for the local folds are similar to values inferred from geologic data. The three-dimensional velocity solution has several distinctive features. There is a linear high-velocity body (6.1\textendash 6.5 km/s), about 25 km long, from 6 to 8 km depth, that may represent a fragment of Coast Range ophiolite. A shallow low-velocity zone (LVZ), which extends for 20 km along the fold axis at about 6 km depth and correlates with LVZs observed in both the refraction and the reflection data, may indicate high pore pressure caused by lateral compressive strain. Deeper LVZs occur within inferred Franciscan material and are characterized by horizontal or southwest dipping zones of varied thickness, 4\textendash 8 km wide and 5\textendash 10 km long. These LVZs may represent multiple thrust faults. Their locations and geometry are consistent with thrust faults inferred with seismic reflection data. The three-dimensional velocity solution compares well to prior two-dimensional seismic reflection and refraction models and observed gravity. The shape of the inferred sedimentary section agrees well with the reflections from the Cenozoic strata. Compared to the refraction model, the three-dimensional solution has similar velocities and similar locations of velocity features but is more detailed in the hypocentral zone where it uses more data. The gravity computed from the three-dimensional velocities is similar to the observed gravity in both shape and amplitude. Both a simple one-dimensional initial model and a complex initial model derived from the refraction interpretation were tried. A simple starting model gave the best results. The S velocity solution has different resolution than the P velocity solution because it uses a different set of stations, and it has lower resolution because it uses fewer arrival times. While the general patterns of velocity variation are similar for both V p and V s , the V s solution tends to have more smearing of velocity features and can have somewhat different locations of velocity features.}

  abstract = {Along the southern Hikurangi subduction zone in the southern North Island, New Zealand, the subduction zone changes from volcanic with moderately weak interseismic coupling, to non-volcanic with strong coupling in Wellington. To investigate how material heterogeneity relates to subduction processes, we compute 3-D seismic properties using 342 earthquakes and 2 shots recorded by a 165-station seismic array. The time base for some telemetered temporary stations was not stable, which required revising the inversion code to allow an additional origin time related to the telemetered stations. Progressive inversions from 2-D to fine 3-D were carried out for Vp, Vp/Vs and Qp. Combined interpretation of these three seismic properties highlights features of the subduction zone. The subducted slab is imaged as a high-velocity, high-Q feature. In the overlying crust, from southeast to northwest, there is low velocity in the accretionary wedge, high velocity in the axial ranges and low velocity in the Wanganui basin. High Vp/Vs and low Qp characterize the crust east of the North Island dextral fault belt. High Vp/Vs is imaged above the subducted slab to 40 km depth in the northern half of the study area. Low Qp is also prominent above the slab, particularly trenchwards of the volcanic region. In marked contrast to the high Vp/Vs, the low Qp above the slab extends as a continuous feature up to the low Qp in the shallow crust underlying the volcanic region. The low QP and high Vp/Vs are correlated with the region of weaker coupling and are consistent with significant subducted sediments with associated fluid release. Vp/Vs is particularly sensitive to overpressured fluid in the compressional forearc, whereas Qp also images the hydrostatically pressured fluid transport in the more permeable extensional volcanic region. The rheology of the lower crust of the overlying plate is a factor in large-scale subduction coupling as evidenced by the terrane boundaries and Haast schist in the section near Wellington. The changing rheology of the lower crust of the overlying plate in the southern North Island also provides a possible explanation for the southward cessation of volcanism. \textcopyright{} 2005 RAS.},

  abstract = {S U M M A R Y We present a 3-D seismic velocity model of the northern South Island, New Zealand, using several combined passive and active-source data sets. This area is the transition from Hikurangi subduction in the North Island to oblique continental collision along the Alpine fault and the Southern Alps, and geodetically observed deformation is consistent with plate motion being primarily taken up on a series of rotating strike-slip faults. We carry out simultaneous inversion for V p and V p /V s and hypocentres using earthquake data recorded by the permanent seismic network and three temporary seismic arrays, also using active-source marine airgun data recorded at onshore stations. We image the subducted Hikurangi slab as a continuous unbroken feature extending from the active subduction zone to the north. Beneath the Marlborough region, the 3-D hypocentres define the subducted slab as a smooth curved feature to over 250-km depth, whereas below the junction of the Awatere and Alpine faults, the seismicity abruptly ends at 100-km depth. The subducting Pacific plate has a thick crust, including greywacke upper crust, which slows subduction. The interaction of the subducted plate with the translating overlying plate forms a 50-km-long zone of apparent crustal thickening with V p {$<$} 7.0 km s -1 observed to 40-km depth. The Australian Plate has a high-velocity block to 65-km depth, aligned with the Separation Point pluton and trending oblique to the subducted slab. This zone of thicker Australian lithosphere may also hinder subduction. The Marlborough faults trend about 25 \textbullet{} to the strike of the underlying subducted slab, so that the relation of faults to the slab varies along the fault strikes, and the overlying plate ranges in thickness from 20 to 50 km along the faults. Thus, the fault interaction with the subducted slab varies, from translating material directly above the subducting plate, to bottoming into a thick ductile region. The lower crust has high V p /V s under the Marlborough faults (except for a region of Haast schist), which may indicate excess fluid released by the subducted plate.},

  abstract = {The dispersion of volcanic emissions in the Earth atmosphere is of interest for climate research, air traffic control and human wellbeing. Current volcanic emission dispersion models rely on fixed-grid structures that often are not able to resolve the fine filamented structure of volcanic emissions being transported in the atmosphere. Here we extend an existing adaptive semi-Lagrangian advection model for volcanic emissions including the sedimentation of volcanic ash. The advection of volcanic emissions is driven by a precalculated wind field. For evaluation of the model, the explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 is chosen, which was one of the largest eruptions in the 20th century. We compare our simulations of the climactic eruption on 15 June 1991 to satellite data of the Pinatubo ash cloud and evaluate different sets of input parameters. We could reproduce the general advection of the Pinatubo ash cloud and, owing to the adaptive mesh, simulations could be performed at a high local resolution while minimizing computational cost. Differences to the observed ash cloud are attributed to uncertainties in the input parameters and the course of Typhoon Yunya, which is probably not completely resolved in the wind data used to drive the model. The best results were achieved for simulations with multiple ash particle sizes.},

We compared two of these new systems with\$\textbackslash\$na COSPEC by measuring SO2 column amounts at K\=ilauea Volcano, Hawaii. The two systems, one calibrated using in-situ SO2 cells, and the other using a calibrated laboratory reference spectrum, employ similar spectrometer hardware, but different\$\textbackslash\$nforeoptics and spectral retrieval algorithms. Accuracy, signal-to-noise, retrieval parameters, and precision were investigated\$\textbackslash\$nfor the two configurations of new miniature spectrometer. Measurements included traverses beneath the plumes from the summit\$\textbackslash\$nand east rift zone of K\=ilauea, and testing with calibration cells of known SO2 concentration. The results obtained from the different methods were consistent with each other, with {$<$}8\% difference in estimated\$\textbackslash\$nSO2 column amounts up to 800 ppm m. A further comparison between the COSPEC and one of the miniature spectrometer configurations,\$\textbackslash\$nthe `FLYSPEC', spans an eight month period and showed agreement of measured emission rates to within 10\% for SO2 column amounts up to 1,600 ppm m. The topic of measuring high SO2 burdens accurately is addressed for the K\=ilauea measurements. In comparing the foreoptics, retrieval methods, and resultant\$\textbackslash\$nimplications for data quality, we aim to consolidate the various experiences to date, and improve the application and development\$\textbackslash\$nof miniature spectrometer systems.},

Competing hypotheses suggest that Himalayan topography is sustained and plate convergence is accommodated either predominantly on the main plate boundary fault, or more broadly across multiple smaller thrust faults. Here we use geodetic measurements of surface displacement to show that the Gorkha earthquake ruptured the Main Himalayan Thrust fault. The earthquake generated about 1[thinsp]m of uplift in the Kathmandu Basin, yet caused the high Himalaya farther north to subside by about 0.6[thinsp]m. We use the geodetic data, combined with geologic, geomorphological and geophysical analyses, to constrain the geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust in the Kathmandu area. Structural analyses together with interseismic and coseismic displacements are best explained by a steep, shallow thrust fault flattening at depth between 5 and 15[thinsp]km and connecting to a mid-crustal, steeper thrust. We suggest that present-day convergence across the Himalaya is mostly accommodated by this fault[mdash]no significant motion on smaller thrust faults is required. Furthermore, given that the Gorkha earthquake caused the high Himalayan mountains to subside and that our fault geometry explains measured interseismic displacements, we propose that growth of Himalayan topography may largely occur during the ongoing post-seismic phase.},

  abstract = {This article provides a thorough meta-analysis of the anomaly detection problem. To accomplish this we first identify approaches to benchmarking anomaly detection algorithms across the literature and produce a large corpus of anomaly detection benchmarks that vary in their construction across several dimensions we deem important to real-world applications: (a) point difficulty, (b) relative frequency of anomalies, (c) clusteredness of anomalies, and (d) relevance of features. We apply a representative set of anomaly detection algorithms to this corpus, yielding a very large collection of experimental results. We analyze these results to understand many phenomena observed in previous work. First we observe the effects of experimental design on experimental results. Second, results are evaluated with two metrics, ROC Area Under the Curve and Average Precision. We employ statistical hypothesis testing to demonstrate the value (or lack thereof) of our benchmarks. We then offer several approaches to summarizing our experimental results, drawing several conclusions about the impact of our methodology as well as the strengths and weaknesses of some algorithms. Last, we compare results against a trivial solution as an alternate means of normalizing the reported performance of algorithms. The intended contributions of this article are many; in addition to providing a large publicly-available corpus of anomaly detection benchmarks, we provide an ontology for describing anomaly detection contexts, a methodology for controlling various aspects of benchmark creation, guidelines for future experimental design and a discussion of the many potential pitfalls of trying to measure success in this field.},

  abstract = {Understanding the location, intensity, and likely duration of volcanic hazards is key to reducing risk from volcanic eruptions. Here, we use a novel near-real-time dataset comprising Volcanic Ash Advisories (VAAs) issued over 10~years to investigate global rates and durations of explosive volcanic activity. The VAAs were collected from the nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAACs) worldwide. Information extracted allowed analysis of the frequency and type of explosive behaviour, including analysis of key eruption source parameters (ESPs) such as volcanic cloud height and duration. The results reflect changes in the VAA reporting process, data sources, and volcanic activity through time. The data show an increase in the number of VAAs issued since 2015 that cannot be directly correlated to an increase in volcanic activity. Instead, many represent increased observations, including improved capability to detect low- to mid-level volcanic clouds (FL101\textendash FL200, 3\textendash 6~km asl), by higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution satellite sensors. Comparison of ESP data extracted from the VAAs with the Mastin et al. (J Volcanol Geotherm Res 186:10\textendash 21, 2009a) database shows that traditional assumptions used in the classification of volcanoes could be much simplified for operational use. The analysis highlights the VAA data as an exceptional resource documenting global volcanic activity on timescales that complement more widely used eruption datasets.},

  abstract = {Data Assimilation comprehensively covers data assimilation and inverse methods, including both traditional state estimation and parameter estimation. This text and reference focuses on various popular data assimilation methods, such as weak and strong constraint variational methods and ensemble filters and smoothers. It is demonstrated how the different methods can be derived from a common theoretical basis, as well as how they differ and/or are related to each other, and which properties characterize them, using several examples. It presents the mathematical framework and derivations in a way which is common for any discipline where dynamics is merged with measurements. The mathematics level is modest, although it requires knowledge of basic spatial statistics, Bayesian statistics, and calculus of variations. Readers will also appreciate the introduction to the mathematical methods used and detailed derivations, which should be easy to follow, are given throughout the book. The codes used in several of the data assimilation experiments are available on a web page. The focus on ensemble methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother, also makes it a solid reference to the derivation, implementation and application of such techniques. Much new material, in particular related to the formulation and solution of combined parameter and state estimation problems and the general properties of the ensemble algorithms, is available here for the first time. The 2nd edition includes a partial rewrite of Chapters 13 an 14, and the Appendix. In addition, there is a completely new Chapter on "Spurious correlations, localization and inflation", and an updated and improved sampling discussion in Chap 11. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The average spectra provide information about the individual sea states which characterise the wave climate, and show that on average the sea state on the east coast is less energetic than it is on the west coast. Further, it is seen that this difference results largely from a dominant and persistent long-period south-westerly swell of 12.4 s period which is present at the Maui location but absent from the Great Barrier Island seas.},

  abstract = {Within historical times one of the most damaging events in intra-plate Europe was the 1356 Basel earthquake. Given its significance for assessing regional seismic hazard in central Europe, an interdisciplinary project was launched in 2005 to re-explore this event. Our ef- fort aimed to incorporate techniques from history, seismology, archaeology, paleoseismology and engineering. New and reinterpreted historical data from Basel and its surroundings plus archaeological findings on buildings that survived the event and still exist enabled thismacro- seismic assessment. Palaeoseismological studies combined with historical evidence provided additional data. For the surrounding areas, archaeology offers sparse information on some cas- tles and churches, sometimes supported by historical records. A contemporary source allows some reconstruction of the stronger fore- and aftershocks. This expanded information base improves our sense of the event's damage and conse- quences. For the city of Basel, the relatively abundant archaeological data allowed us to assess statistically the macroseismic intensity at IX, although the pattern of damage was scattered. Data points for the expected area of damage around Basel are not distributed regularly. The ab- sence of historical and archaeological findings for southern Germany might be due to archival problems; future investigation may improve this situation. Our results confirm that the Basel earthquake was the most destructive known for central Europe. Intensities up to VIII are found within a radius of about 30 km. Analysing the macroseismic field confirms our former assessment of the event and shows an epicenter located about 10 km south of Basel. The most probable range for the moment magnitude Mw is between 6.7 and 7.1.},

  abstract = {Both synthetic and observed ambient vibration array data are analysed using high-resolution beam-forming. In addition to a classical analysis of the vertical component, this paper presents results derived from processing horizontal components.We analyse phase velocities of funda- mental and higher mode Rayleigh and Love waves, and particle motions (ellipticity) retrieved from H/V spectral ratios. A combined inversion with a genetic algorithm and a strategy for selecting possible model parameters allow us to define structural models explaining the data. The results from synthetic data for simple models with one or two layers of sediments suggest that, in most cases, the number of layers has to be reduced to a few sediment strata to find the original structure. Generally, reducing the number of soft-sediment layers in the inversion process with genetic algorithms leads to a class of models that are less smooth. They have a stronger impedance contrast between sediments and bedrock. Combining Love and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves with the ellipticity of the fundamen- tal mode Rayleigh waves has some advantages. Scatter is reduced when compared to using structural models obtained only from Rayleigh wave phase velocity curves. By adding infor- mation from Lovewaves some structures can be excluded. Another possibility for constraining inversion results is to include supplementary geological or borehole information. Analysing radial components also can provide segments of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves for modes not seen on the vertical component. Finally, using ellipticity information allows us to confine the total depth of the soft sediments. For real sites, considerable variability in the measured phase velocity curves is observed. This comes from lateral changes in the structure or seismic sources within the array. Constraining the inversion by combining Love and Rayleigh wave information can help reduce such problems. Frequency bands in which the Rayleigh wave dispersion curves show considerable scatter are often better resolved by Love waves. Information from the horizontal component can be used to correctly assign the mode number to the different phase\textendash velocity curve segments, especially when two modes seem to merge at osculation points. Such merging of modes is usually observed for Rayleighwaves and thus can be partly solved if additional information from the Love waves and the horizontal component of Rayleigh waves is considered. Whenever a site presents a velocity inversion below the top layer, Love wave data clearly helps to better constrain the solution.},

Multiple families of integrative analysis methods have been proposed in the literature. The current review focuses on the penalization methods. Special attention is paid to sparse meta-analysis methods that pool summary statistics across datasets, and integrative analysis methods that pool raw data across datasets. We discuss their formulation and rationale. Beyond `standard' penalized selection, we also review contrasted penalization and Laplacian penalization that accommodate finer data structures. The computational aspects, including computational algorithms and tuning parameter selection, are examined. This review concludes with possible limitations and extensions.

We further show how resampling ideas from particle filters can be used to reduce the computational cost to linear in the number of observations, at the expense of introducing small errors; and propose two new, optimum resampling algorithms for this problem. One, a version of rejection control, allows the particle filter to automatically choose the number of particles required at each time-step. The new resampling algorithms substantially out-perform standard resampling algorithms on examples we consider; and we demonstrate how the resulting particle filter is practicable for segmentation of human GC content.},

  abstract = {Many active volcanoes in the world exhibit Strombolian activity, which is typically characterized by relatively frequent mild events and also by rare and much more destructive major explosions and paroxysms. Detailed analyses of past major and minor events can help to understand the eruptive behavior of the volcano and the underlying physical and chemical processes. Catalogs of volcanic eruptions may be established using continuous seismic recordings at stations in the proximity of volcanoes. However, in many cases, the analysis of the recordings relies heavily on the manual picking of events by human experts. Recently developed Machine Learning-based approaches require large training data sets which may not be available a priori. Here, we propose an alternative automated approach: the Adaptive-Window Volcanic Event Selection Analysis Module (AWESAM). This process of creating event catalogs consists of three main steps: (i) identification of potential volcanic events based on squared ground-velocity amplitudes, an adaptive MaxFilter, and a prominence threshold. (ii) catalog consolidation by comparing and verification of the initial detections based on recordings from two different seismic stations. (iii) identification and exclusion of signals from regional tectonic earthquakes. The software package is applied to publicly accessible continuous seismic recordings from two almost equidistant stations at Stromboli volcano in Italy. We tested AWESAM by comparison with a hand-picked catalog and found that around 95 \% of the eruptions with a signal-to-noise ratio above three are detected. In a first application, we derive a new amplitude-frequency relationship from over 290.000 volcanic events at Stromboli during 2019-2020. The module allows for a straightforward generalization and application to other volcanoes worldwide.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

  abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multi-modal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. Nested Sampling is a Monte Carlo method targeted at the efficient calculation of the evidence, but also produces posterior inferences as a by-product and therefore provides means to carry out parameter estimation as well as model selection. The main challenge in implementing Nested Sampling is to sample from a constrained probability distribution. One possible solution to this problem is provided by the Galilean Monte Carlo (GMC) algorithm. We show results of applying Nested Sampling with GMC to some problems which have proven very difficult for standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and down-hill methods, due to the presence of large number of local minima and/or pronounced (curving) degeneracies between the parameters. We also discuss the use of Nested Sampling with GMC in Bayesian object detection problems, which are inherently multi-modal and require the evaluation of Bayesian evidence for distinguishing between true and spurious detections.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nPublished in: AIP Conference Proceedings, Volume 1553, pp. 106-113 (2013)},

This is based on the construction of an artificial Hamiltonian system where a model is treated as a high-dimensional particle. Depending on its initial momentum and mass matrix, the particle evolves along a trajectory that traverses the effective nullspace, thereby producing a series of alternative models that are consistent with observations and their uncertainties. Variants of the nullspace shuttle enable hypothesis testing, for example, by adding features or by producing smoother or rougher models. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian nullspace shuttle can serve as a tunable hybrid between deterministic and probabilistic inversion methods: Choosing random initial momenta, it resembles Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; requiring misfits to decrease along a trajectory, it transforms into gradient descent. We illustrate the concept with a low-dimensional toy example and with high-dimensional nonlinear inversions of seismic traveltimes and magnetic data, respectively.},

  abstract = {Reported SO2 emission values at strongly degassing volcanoes might be underestimated. Scanning spectroscopic instruments are widely used at volcanoes to quantify SO2 emission rates and, occasionally, molar ratios between SO2 and other gases such as BrO. Frequently, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy is applied to evaluate spectra in the ultraviolet range. If radiative transfer effects are not considered in the evaluations, the retrieved column densities may vary depending on which spectral window is used. We compare the use of different windows for data collected at Popocat\'epetl volcano during strong degassing periods, when high column densities lead to especially high dependence on the applied evaluation window. We propose the use of three different windows (310\textendash 322 nm, 314.7\textendash 326.7 nm and 322\textendash 334 nm) and a simple algorithm to choose the most accurate column density from them. The SO2 evaluation using proper spectral windows would allow a more realistic estimation of the SO2 emission rates.},

  abstract = {The Boiling Lake of Dominica has exhibited stable high-temperature behavior for at least 150 a. This stability is punctuated by occasional crises involving rapid filling and draining of the lake and changes in water temperature. The most recent such crisis occurred in December 2004 to April 2005. Using the results of previous theoretical and experimental work on analogue models, we present a combined thermal, hydrological, and fluid mechanical model of the Boiling Lake. This reveals that the lake appears to be suspended above the local water table by a constant supply of rising steam bubbles sourced from the boiling of groundwater near an igneous intrusion. The bubbles condense in the Boiling Lake, maintaining the temperature at ?90?C. The geometry of the lake- conduit system provides a mechanism for instability, with a denser liquid lake overlying a bubbly fractured permeable conduit. Following a sufficiently large perturbation, the whole lake rapidly drains until the surface is at the local water table level. The persistent gas supply then reinitiates filling. We propose that local seismic activity may have caused shock nucleation of bubbles within the conduit and triggered the instability of the Boiling Lake.},

  abstract = {Changes beneath a volcano can be observed through position changes in a GPS network, but distinguishing the source of site motion is not always straightforward. The records of continuous GPS sites provide a favorable data set for tracking magma migration. Dense campaign observations usually provide a better spatial picture of the overall deformation field, at the expense of an episodic temporal record. Combining these observations provides the best of both worlds. A Kalman filter provides a means for integrating discrete and continuous measurements and for interpreting subtle signals. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is a nonlinear method for time-dependent observations. We demonstrate the application of this technique to deformation data by applying it to GPS data collected at Okmok volcano. Seven years of GPS observations at Okmok are analyzed using a Mogi source model and the UKF. The deformation source at Okmok is relatively stable at 2.5 km depth below sea level, located beneath the center of the caldera, which means the surface deformation is caused by changes in the strength of the source. During the 7 years of GPS observations more than 0.5 m of uplift has occurred, a majority of that during the time period January 2003 to July 2004. The total volume recovery at Okmok since the last eruption in 1997 is {$\sim$}60\textendash 80\%. The UKF allows us to solve simultaneously for the time-dependence of the source strength and for the location without a priori information about the source.},

With small sample sizes, the update step becomes crucial. Particle filtering suffers from the well-known problem of sample degeneracy. Ensemble Kalman filtering avoids this, at the expense of treating non-Gaussian features of the forecast distribution incorrectly. Here we introduce a procedure that makes a continuous transition indexed by {$\gamma$}[0,1] between the ensemble and the particle filter update. We propose automatic choices of the parameter {$\gamma$} such that the update stays as close as possible to the particle filter update subject to avoiding degeneracy. In various examples, we show that this procedure leads to updates that are able to handle non-Gaussian features of the forecast sample even in high-dimensional situations. \textcopyright{} 2013 Biometrika Trust.},

  abstract = {Passive seismic imaging of the earth is a rapidly developing field of study. Recent advances in noise cross correlation techniques allow imaging of isotropic surface-wave and shear-wave velocities in areas where earthquake numbers and distributions are insufficient to implement traditional earthquake based tomography. Furthermore, advances in the theory underpinning surface wave inversion have led to depth-dependent mapping of seismic anisotropy in the lithosphere and upper asthenosphere. We show that by merging these two rapidly advancing fields we can invert noise-based phase velocity measurements for azimuthally anisotropic phase speed, thereby providing a highly resolved image of layered azimuthal anisotropy in continental crust. We apply this new algorithm in the western Alps, an area of complex lithospheric structure. Alpine crustal thickening results from continental collision, indentation of the Ivrea mantle into the middle crust of the European plate, rollback of the European lithospheric mantle, and crustal slicing. We find that anisotropy beneath the central Alps is stratified in two layers - one with an orogen-parallel fast direction above \textasciitilde 30. km depth and another with a strong orogen-perpendicular fast direction at greater depth. Although our resolution is reduced outside the central Alps, we map orogen-parallel anisotropy in the crust of the northern Alpine foreland. We interpret the results in the central Alps as first-order evidence for a model of azimuthal anisotropy in which (1) near-vertical emplacement of crustal slices following detachment of the lithospheric mantle from the crust gives rise to orogen-parallel fast directions of wave propagation in the crust, and (2) dominantly horizontal tectonics in the thickened crustal root and uppermost mantle yield orogen-perpendicular fast directions at greater depth. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Crater lakes in active volcanic vents are unique features providing an insight into the state of natural geothermal systems. Inferno Crater Lake, in the Waimangu Geothermal area near Rotorua, has regular cycles in its temperature and lake level, varying from 12 to 56 days in length. These cycles do not seem to be related to the magmatic activity of Okataina Volcanic Center, rather representing an unstable heat convection system under the lake. The cycling patterns show four different types of cycle, based on sixty-five years of data. Each kind of cycle has a specific behavior of lake temperature and water level. Type II is the most common cycle with a mean length of 33.2 days and one overflow. When successive overflows happen, we have a cycle of type I, with an average length of 56.1 days. The lack of overflow defines the other two types; type III for short cycles lasting about 12.0 days, or a type IV whose mean length is 30.0 days. Even if types I to III show some tendency to repeat, no features of the cycle can be used to predict which type will occur next. All the types of cycle start with the same rapid rise of lake temperature and level. Heavy rainfall and seismic and hydrothermal events do not generate any particular type of cycle. Finally, the regular oscillations which occur during a cycle with an average period of 2.2 days could be generated by accumulating steam pressure in a volume under the lake, similar to a geyser mechanism.},

  abstract = {The traditional approach to both earthquake and Global Positioning System (GPS) location problems in a homogeneous half-space produces a nonlinear relationship between a set of known positions, seismic stations or GPS satellites, and an unknown point, an earthquake hypocenter or GPS receiver. Linearization, followed by an iterative inversion, is typically used to solve both problems. Although sources and receivers are swapped in the earthquake and GPS location problems, the observation equation is the same for both, due to the principle of reciprocity. Consequently, the mechanical part of the solution of the equations is the same and single-step closed-form solutions for the GPS location problem, such as the Bancroft algorithm, can also be used to solve for earthquake hypocenters in a homogeneous half-space. This article applies the Bancroft algorithm to synthetic and real data for the Charlevoix seismic zone and compares the location of similar to 1200 events estimated with both the Bancroft algorithm and HYPOINVERSE. The Bancroft algorithm shows quantifiable improvements in accuracy compared with traditional methods. We also show how tools commonly used by the GPS community, such as the geometric dilution of precision, can be used to better estimate the precision of the results obtained by a seismic network.},

  abstract = {The amount of recorded seismic event data is rapidly growing, and manual processing by trained human experts to infer hypocenter, source parameters, and moment tensor solutions is therefore no longer feasible. Automated procedures are required to process data efficiently and include quality-control measures that allow for outlier detection. We present a modular cross-correlation location (CCLoc) algorithm for induced seismicity that uses cross correlations of either raw seismograms or characteristic functions derived from them followed by a reverse migration procedure. The novelty of this approach is the inclusion of cross pairs of P and S arrivals and the inclusion of autocorrelations, both of which add a distance constraint to the hypocenter estimation. The algorithm is modular in the sense that preprocessing can be tailored to specific data or task.Nine months of seismic data from an underground hard-rock tin mine are processed in a fully automated mode using a machine-learning approach for seismic phase arrival detection and using the estimated arrival functions as input for CCLoc. Making use of the average cross-correlation value as a quality constraint, CCLoc can successfully infer source information on 92\% of previously manually processed data. The accuracy of automatic processing is demonstrated by comparing hypocenter, source parameter, and moment tensor solutions between the two datasets. The algorithm will potentially aid the analysis of induced or other seismicity and is particularly well suited to use in the case of large numbers of seismic sensors recording many events.},

Data from the network will be used primarily for volcanic risk assessment but also for geophysical research, studies of atmospheric change, and ground validation of satellite instruments. A novel type of instrument, the scanning miniaturized differential optical absorption spectroscopy (Mini-\{DOAS)\} instrument, is applied in the network to measure volcanic gas emissions by \{UV\} absorption spectroscopy. The instrument is set up 5\textendash 10 km downwind of the volcano under study, and typically two to four instruments are deployed at each volcano in order to cover different wind directions and to facilitate measurements of plume height and plume direction. Two different versions of the instrument have been developed. Version I was designed to be a robust and simple instrument for measurement of volcanic \{SO2\} emissions at high time resolution with minimal power consumption. Version \{II\} was designed to allow the best possible spectroscopy and enhanced flexibility in regard to measurement geometry at the cost of larger complexity, power consumption, and price. In this paper the project is described, as well as the developed software, the hardware of the two instrument versions, measurement strategies, data communication, and archiving routines. As of April 2009 a total of 46 instruments have been installed at 18 volcanoes worldwide. As a typical example, the installation at Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador is described, together with some results from the first 21 months of operation at this volcano.},

  abstract = {We used cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise recorded in the Chile Triple Junction (CTJ) region to estimate interstation surface wave time-domain Green's functions, and then inverted traveltimes to obtain crustal surface wave velocity models. Interstation distances within the Chile Ridge Subduction Project (CRSP) temporary seismic network ranged from 40 to \textasciitilde 100 km. We selected 365 d, and cross-correlated and stacked 24 hr of vertical component data at 38 stations pairs, resulting in nominally 703 traveltimes along assumed-straight interstation paths. Velocities in 2-D cells of 30 km \texttimes{} 30 km were calculated using a linear least-squares inversion of the Rayleigh wave group velocity traveltimes. Furthermore we performed a Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion analysis to estimate the sensitivity of different period waves at depth and to calculate a 3-D shear velocity model of the Patagonian crust. The process was applied to cross correlation pairs determined in two period bands, 5-10 s, corresponding to shallow crustal velocities down to approximately 10 km depth, and 10-20 s, for velocities down to around 20 km. Our results show that cell velocities correlate well with known geological features. We find high-crustal velocities where the Patagonian Batholith outcrops or is likely present at depth, and low velocities correlate with the active volcanic arc of the Southern Volcanic Zone and the subducted Chile ridge in Taitao peninsula, where thermal activity of hot springs is present. High velocities in the mountainous portions of the southeastern study area appear to correlate with outcropping older metamorphic units. Low velocity in the east correlate with sequences of volcaniclastic deposits. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2010 RAS.},

  abstract = {Common kinematic strong motion modeling techniques can be divided into integral and composite according to the source representation. In the integral approach, we usually consider the rupture propagating in the form of a slip pulse, creating the k-squared final slip distribution. Such a model is acceptable on large scales where the faulting process is assumed to be deterministic, which is also supported by low-frequency slip inversions. Nevertheless, on small scales the real rupture is rather disorganized (chaotic) and requires a stochastic description. This is involved in the composite approach, in which the source acts as a discrete sequence of individually rupturing subevents. However, this model usually leads to incorrect spectral amplitudes in the low-frequency band (as compared to the integral model). The purpose of this study is to propose a hybrid kinematic k-squared source model based on a set of subsources, scaled to provide the k-squared slip distribution. The modeling combines: (1) the integral approach at low frequencies, based on the representation theorem and the k-squared slip distribution (obtained by composing subsources slip contributions), and (2) the composite approach at high frequencies, based on the summation of ground motion contributions from the subsources, treated as individual point sources. The same set of subsources is used in both the approaches, i.e. for both the frequency ranges. The hybrid method is numerically efficient, while minimizing the above-mentioned problems of both the techniques. The source model is applied to two events: 1999 Athens (Mw = 5.9) and 1997 Kagoshima (Mw = 6.1) earthquake examples. In the first example, the simulated PGAs are examined with respect to the attenuation relation for Greece. In the second example, synthetic velocigrams are compared with observed data showing that, despite the neglected site-effects, the complexities of measured waveforms are relatively well reproduced. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Typically, inversion algorithms assume that a forward model, which relates a source to its resulting measurements, is known and fixed. Using collected indirect measurements and the forward model, the goal becomes to recover the source. When the forward model is unknown, or imperfect, artifacts due to model mismatch occur in the recovery of the source. In this paper, we study the problem of blind inversion: solving an inverse problem with unknown or imperfect knowledge of the forward model parameters. We propose DeepGEM, a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that can be used to solve for the unknown parameters of the forward model in an unsupervised manner. DeepGEM makes use of a normalizing flow generative network to efficiently capture complex posterior distributions, which leads to more accurate evaluation of the source's posterior distribution used in EM. We showcase the effectiveness of our DeepGEM approach by achieving strong performance on the challenging problem of blind seismic tomography, where we significantly outperform the standard method used in seismology. We also demonstrate the generality of DeepGEM by applying it to a simple case of blind deconvolution.},

Sigma-point approximations to the general Gaussian Rauch\textendash Tung\textendash Striebel smoother are widely used methods to tackle this problem. These algorithms perform statistical linear regression (SLR) of the nonlinear functions considering only the previous measurements. We argue that SLR should be done taking all measurements into account. We propose the iterated posterior linearisation smoother (IPLS), which is an iterated algorithm that performs SLR of the nonlinear functions with respect to the current posterior approximation. The algorithm is demonstrated to outperform conventional Gaussian nonlinear smoothers in two numerical examples.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification is a hot topic in the interpretation of SAR images. However, the absence of effective feature representation and the presence of speckle noise in SAR images make classification difficult to handle. In order to overcome these problems, a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is proposed to extract features and conduct classification automatically. The deep network is composed of eight layers: a convolutional layer to extract texture features, a scale transformation layer to aggregate neighbor information, four layers based on sparse autoencoders to optimize features and classify, and last two layers for postprocessing. Compared with hand-crafted features, the DCAE network provides an automatic method to learn discriminative features from the image. A series of filters is designed as convolutional units to comprise the gray-level cooccurrence matrix and Gabor features together. Scale transformation is conducted to reduce the influence of the noise, which integrates the correlated neighbor pixels. Sparse autoencoders seek better representation of features to match the classifier, since training labels are added to fine-tune the parameters of the networks. Morphological smoothing removes the isolated points of the classification map. The whole network is designed ingeniously, and each part has a contribution to the classification accuracy. The experiments of TerraSAR-X image demonstrate that the DCAE network can extract efficient features and perform better classification result compared with some related algorithms.},

In the past 15 years, time-dependent earthquake probabilities based on a generic short-term clustering model have been made publicly available in near-real time during major earthquake sequences. These forecasts describe the probability and number of events that are, on average, likely to occur following a mainshock of a given magnitude, but are not tailored to the particular sequence at hand and contain no information about the likely locations of the aftershocks. Our model builds upon the basic principles of this generic forecast model in two ways: it recasts the forecast in terms of the probability of strong ground shaking, and it combines an existing time-independent earthquake occurrence model based on fault data and historical earthquakes with increasingly complex models describing the local time-dependent earthquake clustering. The result is a time-dependent map showing the probability of strong shaking anywhere in California within the next 24 hours. The seismic hazard modelling approach we describe provides a better understanding of time-dependent earthquake hazard, and increases its usefulness for the public, emergency planners and the media.},

  abstract = {The complex system required for carbon capture and storage (CCS) encompasses numerous sub-systems with inter-dependencies and large parameter uncertainties that propagate throughout the system. Exploring and understanding these inter-dependencies and uncertainties is invaluable for developing robust risk information. Bayesian Networks (BN), a decision support tool, are being increasingly used in the broader risk assessment community and show promise for use in CCS. BNs explore the dependencies and uncertainties within a system and have the potential to provide a better understanding of risk than more traditional tools such as logic trees or other less integrated approaches. Working with experts from within the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC), we have developed a generic BN structure for the storage sub-system of CCS which can be used to guide the development of BNs for other CCS applications and for use in both diagnostic and predictive analysis. This bi-directionality provides one of the more important benefits of BNs; it allows for (1) traditional bottom-up risk assessment where the likely consequences based on the expected state of the system can be calculated and also (2) top-down, or outcome oriented risk, where the state of the system leading to a particular outcome, such as the likelihood of 2\% leakage in 1000 years, is determined. This allows for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis which highlights important contributors to the risk and also where additional knowledge may benefit the project and reduce uncertainty. A robust expert elicitation procedure, for both the development of the network structure and the determination of event probabilities, is an integral part of the use of any such BN tool in CCS. Finally, we show the direct application of a smaller CCS BN by the CO2CRC.},

The BN estimates the probability that the CO2CRC Otway Stage 2C experiment is successful in detecting a CO2 plume injected into a saline aquifer and in confirming stabilisation of the plume using a 4D seismic survey. To develop the BN structure, Otway Stage 2C scientists and managers identified the key variables impacting the success of the experiment and their relations. To estimate the conditional probabilities required to quantify the BN, we applied the Classical Model. This is a non-consensus procedure for combining expert judgement that involves weighting a group of experts according to their ability to judge uncertainties accurately and informatively. The experts participated in open discussion about the BN and provided, individually, all probabilities required to complete the BN. The primary result was a 74\% probability of detecting the plume, and a 57\% probability that there will be consistency between the model-predicted plume behaviour and the observations.},

A potentially important observable is the release of heat through volcano surfaces, which represents a major energy source at quiescent volcanoes. However, it remains unclear whether surface heat emissions respond to pre-eruptive processes and vary before eruption. Here we show through a statistical analysis of satellite-based long-wavelength (10.780\textendash 11.280 {$\mu$}m) infrared data that the last magmatic and phreatic eruptions of five different volcanoes were preceded by subtle but significant long-term (years), large-scale (tens of square kilometres) increases in their radiant heat flux (up to \textasciitilde 1 \textdegree C in median radiant temperature). Large-scale thermal unrest is detected even before eruptions that were not anticipated from other volcano monitoring methods, such as the 2014 phreatic eruption of Ontake (Japan) and the 2015 magmatic eruption of Calbuco (Chile). We attribute large-scale thermal unrest to the enhancement of underground hydrothermal activity, and suggest that such analysis of satellite-based infrared observations can improve constraints on the thermal budget of volcanoes, early detection of pre-eruptive conditions and assessments of volcanic alert levels. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Linking volcano-seismic signals with subsurface processes is crucial to improve the forecasting of volcanic eruptions. One of the most enigmatic signals is shallow volcanic tremor, a highly periodic ground vibration that is typically sourced beneath the crater of active volcanoes, is long lasting (from minutes to years), appears during unrest periods, and frequently precedes eruptions. In this paper, we demonstrate that shallow tremor can be produced by periodic pressure oscillations emerging spontaneously beneath permeable media (e.g., fractured magma caps). These pressure oscillations are the result of three concurrent processes: (a) the transient porous flow of gases through the permeable cap; (b) the temporary accumulation of these gases beneath the cap, forming a gas pocket; and (c) the random supply of volatiles from deeper levels. For highly permeable media ({$\geq$}10-12 m2; realistic for shallow volcanic edifices), the pressure in subsurface gas pockets is governed by the equation of a linear oscillator; hence, under proper conditions, periodic pressure oscillations emerge during the transfer of gases from the Earth's interior to the surface. Our model is consistent with geophysical data showing that the tremor source is localized at a fixed region and can explain the main characteristics of ground vibrations, including frequency gliding, variations of seismic amplitude prior to eruptions, and the different types of tremor observed. For thin permeable caps ({$<$}100 m), we find that different eruption mechanisms (e.g., magma ascent vs. cap sealing) leave distinct footprints in the tremor properties, thus opening new perspectives to forecast the type and style of impending eruptions.},

  abstract = {Models of the velocity structure of volcanoes can help define possible magma pathways and contribute to calculating more accurate earthquake locations, which can help with monitoring volcanic activity. However, shear-wave velocity of volcanoes is difficult to determine from traditional seismic techniques, such as local earthquake tomography (LET) or refraction/reflection surveys. Here we use the recently developed technique of noise cross correlation of continuous seismic data to investigate the subsurface shear-wave velocity structure of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre (TgVC) of New Zealand, focusing on the active Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. We observe both the fundamental and first higher-order modes of Rayleigh and Love waves within our noise dataset, made from stacks of 15min cross-correlation functions. We manually pick group velocity dispersion curves from over 1900 correlation functions, of which we consider 1373 to be high quality. We subsequently invert a subset of the fundamental mode Rayleigh- and Love-wave dispersion curves both independently and jointly for one dimensional shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles at Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. Vs increases very slowly at a rate of approximately 0.2km/s per km depth beneath Ruapehu, suggesting that progressive hydrothermal alteration mitigates the effects of compaction driven velocity increases. At Tongariro, we observe larger Vs increases with depth, which we interpret as different layers within Tongariro's volcanic system above altered basement greywacke. Slow Vs, on the order of 1\textendash 2km/s, are compatible with P-wave velocities (using a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.7) from existing velocity profiles of areas within the TgVC, and the observations of worldwide studies of shallow volcanic systems that used ambient noise cross-correlation methods. Most of the measured group velocities of fundamental mode Love-waves across the TgVC are 0.1\textendash 0.4km/s slower than those of fundamental mode Rayleigh-waves in the frequency range of 0.25\textendash 1Hz. First-higher mode Love-waves are similarly slower than first-higher mode Rayleigh waves. This is incompatible with synthetic dispersion curves we calculate using isotropic, layered velocity models appropriate for Ruapehu and Tongariro, in which Love waves travel more quickly than Rayleigh waves of the same period. The Love-Rayleigh discrepancy is likely due to structures such as dykes or cracks in the vertical plane having increased influence on surface-wave propagation. However, several measurements at Ruapehu have Love-wave group velocities that are faster than Rayleigh-wave group velocities. The differences between the Love- and Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves also vary with the azimuth of the interstation path across Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes. Significant azimuthal dependence of both Love and Rayleigh-wave velocities are also observed. This suggests azimuthal anisotropy within the volcanic structures, which coupled with radial anisotropy, makes the Vs structures of Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes anisotropic with orthorhombic or lower order symmetry. We suggest that further work to determine three-dimensional volcanic structures should include provisions for such anisotropy.},

The methods rely on a particle representation of the filtering distributions, and their evolution through time using sequential importance sampling and resampling ideas. In particular, novel techniques are presented for generation of sample realizations of historical state sequences. This is carried out in a forward-filtering backward-smoothing procedure that can be viewed as the nonlinear, non-Gaussian counterpart of standard Kalman filter-based simulation smoothers in the linear Gaussian case. Convergence in the mean squared error sense of the smoothed trajectories is proved, showing the validity of our proposed method. The methods are tested in a substantial application for the processing of speech signals represented by a time-varying autoregression and parameterized in terms of time-varying partial correlation coefficients, comparing the results of our algorithm with those from a simple smoother based on the filtered trajectories. \textcopyright{} 2004 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {Seismic surface waves are usually composed of overlapping wave trains representing multipath propagation. A first task in the analysis of such waves is to identify and separate the various component wave trains so that each can be analyzed separately.Phase-matched filters are a class of linear filters in which the Fourier phase of the filter is made equal to that of a given signal. Herrin and Goforth (1977) described an iterative technique which can be used to find a phase-matched filter for a particular component of a seismic signal. Application of the filters to digital records of Rayleigh waves allowed multiple arrivals to be identified and removed, and allowed recovery of the complex spectrum of the primary wave train along with its apparent group-velocity dispersion curve.A comparable analysis of Love waves presents additional complications. Love waves are contaminated by both Love and Rayleigh multipathing and by primary off-axis Rayleigh energy. In the case of explosions, there is much less energy generated as Love waves than as Rayleigh waves.The applicability of phase-matched filtering to Love waves is demonstrated by its use on earthquakes occurring in the Norwegian Sea and near Iceland and on a nuclear explosion in Novaya Zemlya. Despite severe multipathing in two of the three events, the amplitude and phase of each of the primary Love waves were recovered without significant distortion.}

  abstract = {The traditional approach to both earthquake and Global Positioning System (GPS) location problems in a homogeneous half-space produces a nonlinear relationship between a set of known positions, seismic stations or GPS satellites, and an unknown point, an earthquake hypocenter or GPS receiver. Linearization, followed by an iterative inversion, is typically used to solve both problems. Although sources and receivers are swapped in the earthquake and GPS location problems, the observation equation is the same for both, due to the principle of reciprocity. Consequently, the mechanical part of the solution of the equations is the same and single-step closedform solutions for the GPS location problem, such as the Bancroft algorithm, can also be used to solve for earthquake hypocenters in a homogeneous half-space. This article applies the Bancroft algorithm to synthetic and real data for the Charlevoix seismic zone and compares the location of \textasciitilde 1200 events estimated with both the Bancroft algorithm and HYPOINVERSE. The Bancroft algorithm shows quantifiable improvements in accuracy compared with traditional methods. We also show how tools commonly used by the GPS community, such as the geometric dilution of precision, can be used to better estimate the precision of the results obtained by a seismic network.}

Several construction heuristics and neighbourhoods are compared empirically. The best combination is further enhanced by a diversification strategy and a dynamic evaluation criterion. Tests show that it outperforms previously published approaches and finds optimal solutions quickly and consistently. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We present here the theory for modelling secondary microseismic noise by normal mode summation. We show that the noise sources can be modelled by vertical forces and how to derive them from a realistic ocean wave model. We then show how to compute bathymetry excitation effect in a realistic earth model by using normal modes and a comparison with Longuet-Higgins approach. The strongest excitation areas in the oceans depends on the bathymetry and period and are different for each seismic mode. Seismic noise is then modelled by normal mode summation considering varying bathymetry. We derive an attenuation model that enables to fit well the vertical component spectra whatever the station location. We show that the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves is the dominant signal in seismic noise. There is a discrepancy between real and synthetic spectra on the horizontal components that enables to estimate the amount of Love waves for which a different source mechanism is needed. Finally, we investigate noise generated in all the oceans around Africa and show that most of noise recorded in Algeria (TAM station) is generated in the Northern Atlantic and that there is a seasonal variability of the contribution of each ocean and sea.},

  abstract = {Unusual low-frequency seismic events have recently begun to occur beneath Tongariro Volcano, New Zealand. Because the seismic waveforms appear similar to waveforms called tornillos, which have been recorded at Galeras Volcano in Colombia and have been found to precede small to medium-sized ash eruptions there by several weeks to months, we are monitoring them closely. At Tongariro, these events are characterised by small-amplitude, monochromatic or multichromatic waveforms that decay slowly with time, features that suggest a source involving magmatic or hydrothermal fluids within a zone surrounded by hard rock. The frequency content of monochromatic events is typically between 1 and 3 Hz and is often found to be peaked at f=1.2 Hz. Event durations range from about 10 to 80 s; the appearance of the shorter-duration events is identical to so-called LP or long-period events; the LPs and tornillos appear to be co-located so that the only difference between LPs and tornillos is the extended duration of the latter. These events have been identified in the seismograms of the permanent monitoring station KAVZ since at least January, 2001, occurring at a rate of about one per month. During June\textendash August, 2001, the rate of occurrence gradually increased, peaking in September, 2001, at several events per day. We deployed two broadband and several short-period seismometers at close distances to the expected source location. The resulting seismograms show a complex mixture of seismic waves, originating from shallow depth beneath the area of the Te Maari Craters, located approximately 0.5 km from the nearest station. The close range, broadband records reveal some interesting details about the tornillo source. The tornillo waveform is found to consist of two parts: a low-frequency (f{$\sim$}1.2 Hz) part and a higher-frequency (f{$>$}3 Hz) part. The high-frequency energy travels at body wave speeds (c{$\sim$}3.0 km/s) while the low-frequency energy travels at the speed of shear or surface waves in the shallow crust (c{$\sim$}1 km/s). Interestingly, for some events, the low-frequency waves arrive before the high-frequency body waves at the closest station. This, and comparison with several LP events, suggests a spatial separation of the high- and low-frequency sources, with the low-frequency energy originating at shallow depth and acting as a trigger for the release of tectonic stress at greater depth, in the form of high-frequency body waves.},

  abstract = {Continental rifting and seafloor spreading play a fundamental role in the generation of new crust. However, the distribution of magma and its relationship with tectonics and volcanism remain poorly understood, particularly in back-arc settings. We show evidence for a large, long-lived, off-axis magmatic intrusion located on the margin of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Geodetic data acquired since the 1950s show evidence for uplift outside of the region of active extension, consistentwith the inflation of a magmatic body at a depth of {$\sim$}9.5km. Satellite radar interferometry and Global Positioning System data suggest that there was an increase in the inflation rate from 2003 to 2011, which correlateswith intense earthquake activity in the region. Our results suggest that the continued growth of a large magmatic body may represent the birth of a new magma chamber on themargins of a back-arc rift system.}

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for short-term forecasting of volcano seismic activity. Volcanic earthquakes can be seen as a response mechanism of the earth crust to stresses induced by magma injection. From this point of view the temporal evolution of seismicity can be represented as a diffusion process which compensates pressure differences. By means of this dynamical approach we are able to estimate the system behavior in the near future which in turn allows us to forecast the evolution of the earthquake rate for the next time span from actual and past observations. For this purpose we model the earthquake rate as a random walk process embedded in a moving and deforming potential function. The center of the potential function is given by a moving average of the random walk's trace. We successfully apply this procedure to estimate the next day seismicity at Soufri\`ere Hills volcano, Montserrat, over a time period of six years. When comparing the dynamical approach to the well known method of material failure forecast we find much better predictions of the critical stages of volcanic activity using the new approach. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The ratio of advective time to convective turnover time is also taken into account for the scale-aware parameterization. In addition, the present deep cumulus convection closure using the quasi-equilibrium assumption is no longer used for grid sizes smaller than a threshold value. For the shallow cumulus convection scheme, the cloud-base mass flux is modified to be given by a function of mean updraft velocity. A simple aerosol-aware parameterization where rain conversion in the convective updraft is modified by aerosol number concentration is also included in the update. Along with the scale- and aerosol-aware parameterizations, more changes are made to the schemes. The cloud-base mass-flux computation in the deep convection scheme is modified to use convective turnover time as the convective adjustment time scale. The rain conversion rate is modified to decrease with decreasing air temperature above the freezing level. Convective inhibition in the subcloud layer is used as an additional trigger condition. Convective cloudiness is enhanced by considering suspended cloud condensate in the updraft. The lateral entrainment in the deep convection scheme is also enhanced to more strongly suppress convection in a drier environment. The updated NCEP GFS cumulus convection schemes display significant improvements especially in the summertime continental U.S. precipitation forecasts.},

Major earthquakes that can slip more than several meters, aftershocks, and near-fault background seismicity mostly rupture different surfaces within these fault zones. Major earthquakes rupture along the mapped traces of the late Quaternary faults, called the principal slip zones (PSZs). Aftershocks occur either on or in the immediate vicinity of the PSZs, typically within zones that are {$\pm$}2-km wide. In contrast, the near-fault background seismicity is mostly accommodated on a secondary heterogeneous network of small slip surfaces, and forms spatially decaying distributions extending out to distances of {$\pm$}10 km from the PSZs. We call the regions where the enhanced rate of background seismicity occurs, the seismic damage zones. One possible explanation for the presence of the seismic damage zones and associated seismicity is that the damage develops as faults accommodate bends and geometrical irregularities in the PSZs. The seismic damage zones mature and reach their finite width early in the history of a fault, during the first few kilometers of cumulative offset. Alternatively, the similarity in width of seismic damage zones suggests that most fault zones are of almost equal strength, although the amount of cumulative offset varies widely. It may also depend on the strength of the fault zone, the time since the last major earthquake as well as other parameters. In addition, the seismic productivity appears to be influenced by the crustal structure and heat flow, with more extensive fault networks in regions of thin crust and high heat flow.},

  abstract = {The geographical distribution of the (1981-2005) seismicity in southern California forms a +/- 150 km broad zone adjacent to the Pacific-North America plate boundary, ranging from depths of similar to 1-similar to 30 km, with the bulk of the focal depths in the range of 2-12 km. The distribution of the seismicity that includes both mainshock-aftershock sequences and background events is affected by both static and kinematic geophysical parameters of the crust. The static parameters include heat flow, topography, crustal density, V-p/V-s ratio, hypocentral fault-distance and crustal thickness from receiver functions. The tectonic loading is represented by kinematic parameters such as the crustal shear strain rate field, and the dilatational strain rate field. In our analysis, we normalize the seismicity relative to the areal density of the range of values of each of the parameters. Most of the seismicity occurs in areas of average heat flow, low to intermediate topography, average V-p/V-s and high late Quaternary fault density, and forms seismogenic zones that extend through the brittle crust. The location of late Quaternary faults, often described as zones of weakness, influences the geographical distribution of seismicity more than any other parameter. Although above or below average crustal properties such as high heat flow, thin crust or very low V-p/V-s values exist, these properties only influence the spatial distribution of seismicity in a minor way. As an example, the Salton Trough area of low topography, high heat flow, high V-p/V-s, high shear strain rate and thin crust has distributed seismicity within a thin seismogenic zone. Also, somewhat surprisingly, areas of high topography, low heat flow, low V-p/V-s, low shear strain rate and thick crust have low seismicity rates but a thin seismogenic zone. We determine an empirical relationship between heat flow and crustal thickness to show how the similar to 400 degrees C temperature isotherm gradually deepens with crustal thickness and forms the base of the seismogenic zone for crustal thicknesses from 22 to 37 km. For crustal thickness ranging from 37 to 43 km, the similar to 250 degrees C isotherm forms the base of the seismogenic zone, suggesting that seismic faulting in these regions is confined to the top of the upper crust (12-14 km), and thus does not accommodate plate motion.},

A recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) technique formalized by Green, the so-called trans-dimensional samplers, allows us to sample between these trade-offs and to parsimoniously arbitrate between the varying complexity of candidate models. Here we present a novel framework using trans-dimensional sampling over tree structures. This new class of McMC sampler can be applied to 1-D, 2-D and 3-D Cartesian and spherical geometries. In addition, the basis functions used by the algorithm are flexible and can include more advanced parametrizations such as wavelets, both in Cartesian and Spherical geometries, to permit Bayesian multiscale analysis. This new framework offers greater flexibility, performance and efficiency for geophysical imaging problems than previous sampling algorithms. Thereby increasing the range of applications and in particular allowing extension to trans-dimensional imaging in 3-D. Examples are presented of its application to 2-D seismic and 3-D teleseismic tomography including estimation of uncertainty.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Feature importance is the process where the individual elements of a machine learning model's feature vector are ranked on their relative importance to the accuracy of that model. Some feature ranking algorithms are specific to a single model type, such as Garson and Goh's neural network weight-based feature ranking algorithm. Other feature ranking algorithms are model agnostic, such as Brieman's perturbation feature ranking algorithm. This paper provides implementations for both the neural network weight-based and perturbation feature ranking algorithms for Google's TensorFlow Deep Learning framework. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel hybrid approach of these two feature ranking algorithms that produces a stable ranking of features earlier in the training epochs of a deep neural network. Earlier stabilization of feature rank can save considerable compute cycles during model searches and feature engineering where many representations of the feature vector must be compared. This paper demonstrates all three algorithms by empirically showing that the introduced hybrid weight perturbation algorithms achieves earlier stability than the established algorithms.},

  abstract = {A study of seafloor and island stations shows that for the frequency band 0.1 to 10 Hz the seismic noise levels on islands are comparable to the levels on the seafloor. The microseism peak at the seafloor appears to be comparable to the highest levels observed on small islands. For this band, seafloor stations are realistic alternatives when island sites are not available. Seven year averages of the ambient noise levels recorded by Seismic Research Observatory (SRO) stations on three islands (Guam [GUMO], Taiwan [TATO], and New Zealand's north island [SNZO]) are compared with those recorded by the International Deployment of Accelerometers (IDA) station on Easter Island and on and beneath the ocean floor by Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs) and the Marine Seismic System (MSS) deployed in a south Pacific DSDP drill hole at 23.8\{degrees\}S., 165.5\{degrees\}W (Adair et al., 1986). From 0.3 to 2 Hz the SRO displacement power levels fall in the range historically observed by the Scripps' OBSs (decreasing at 70 dB/decade from 1 by 106 nm2/Hz at 0.3 Hz to 1 nm2/Hz at 2 Hz) and are 10 to 15 dB above MSS levels. Above 2 Hz it appears that the same ratios hold (the SRO power levels decrease at 70 dB/decade to 1 by 10-3 nm2/Hz at a frequency of 10 Hz), although this correlation is based on very limited, high gain, short-period data. At frequencies below 0.3 Hz the SRO noise levels peak and decrease to approximately 2 by 103 nm2/Hz at 40 mHz. The noise levels recorded at Easter Island are somewhat higher (decreasing at 70 dB/decade from 1 by 107 nm2/Hz at 0.2 Hz to 1 nm2/Hz at 10 Hz and to 1 by 105 nm2/Hz at 50 mHz). At the microseism peak near 0.2 Hz the MSS levels are from 15 to 20 dB higher than observed by the SRO stations and equivalent to those recorded at Easter Island. There appears to be little dependence of the variance in noise level estimates on frequency. The upper 95 per cent confidence limit generally lies 10 dB above the average noise levels for all island stations. All island noise level curves are dominated by the broad double-frequency microseism peak centered between 0.15 to 0.2 Hz. The single-frequency peak ranges from absent (Easter Island) to discernable (Guam and New Zealand) to obvious (at Taiwan). The center frequency of this peak ranges from 0.07 Hz at Guam and New Zealand to 0.1 Hz at Taiwan. We speculate that the increased amplitude and frequency of the single-frequency microseism peak is due to the interaction between the shallow continental shelf and surface gravity waves and/or the presence of Taiwan in a region of limited fetch.}

In this study, we develop an efficient parallel weighted Runge\textendash Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (WRKDG) method on unstructured meshes for solving 3D seismic wave equations. The DG method we use is based on the first-order formulation of a hyperbolic system with an explicit weighted Runge\textendash Kutta time discretization. We describe the numerical scheme and parallel implementation in detail, and analyze the stability condition and numerical dispersion and dissipation. We carry out a convergence test on unstructured meshes and investigate the parallel efficiency of the implementation of the WRKDG method. The speedup curve shows that the method has good parallel performance. Finally, we present several numerical simulation examples, including acoustic and elastic wave propagations in isotropic and anisotropic media. Numerical results further verify the effectiveness of the WRKDG method in solving 3D wave propagation problems.},

  abstract = {Estimations of porosity and permeability from well logs are important yet difficult tasks encountered in geophysical formation evaluation and reservoir engineering. Motivated by recent results of artificial neural network (ANN) modelling offshore eastern Canada, we have developed neural nets for converting well logs in the North Sea to porosity and permeability. We use two separate back-propagation ANNs (BP-ANNs) to model porosity and permeability. The porosity ANN is a simple three-layer network using sonic, density and resistivity logs for input. The permeability ANN is slightly more complex with four inputs (density, gamma ray, neutron porosity and sonic) and more neurons in the hidden layer to account for the increased complexity in the relationships. The networks, initially developed for basin-scale problems, perform sufficiently accurately to meet normal requirements in reservoir engineering when applied to Jurassic reservoirs in the Viking Graben area. The mean difference between the predicted porosity and helium porosity from core plugs is less than 0.01 fractional units. For the permeability network a mean difference of approximately 400 mD is mainly due to minor core-log depth mismatch in the heterogeneous parts of the reservoir and lack of adequate overburden corrections to the core permeability. A major advantage is that no a priori knowledge of the rock material and pore fluids is required. Real-time conversion based on measurements while drilling (MWD) is thus an obvious application.}

For inclusion in a prognostic water quality model it is vital to be able to calculate, rather than measure, these energy terms and to relate them to routinely observed meteorological parameters such as air temperature and cloud cover. Here various formulae are analyzed and compared by using two climatologically different data bases. For shortwave radiation the formulae recommended for use, in the dearth of local observations, are those of Prescott (1940) (for temporal scales of weeks or months) and Tucker (1982) (for shorter time scales). The shortwave albedo can be given by the parametrization of Pivovarov (1972), the incoming long-wave atmospheric radiation by a blackbody representation modified by an effective atmospheric emissivity (Raphael, 1962), and the evaporative flux by the equation of Sill (1983), with the sensible heat flux being related to the evaporative energy flux via the Bowen ratio under conditions of neutral atmospheric stability.},

  abstract = {For over 6 million years in the Early Miocene, the Northland Peninsula of New Zealand's North Island was the site of a volcanic arc, comprising north-westerly trending twin belts of marine and subaerial andesitic volcanoes. Approximately 50 volcanic edifices, from major massifs to small cones, have been newly identified on marine seismic profiles of the western belt, which is largely buried. The volcanoes were important point sources of sediment, and the volcaniclastic deposits of each of the major and intermediate sized volcanoes form distinct seismic sequences. The three main elements of the volcanic sequence are (i) a main body, (ii) a sloping apron and (iii) a wide, almost flat ring plain. The downlap of the oldest discernible internal clinoform reflector, relative to a known regional marker reflector underlying it, indicates the approximate time of onset of activity, whereas downlap of the top bounding reflector relative to those of other volcanic sequences provides a relative order of extinction. Sequence stratigraphic principles and super-position determine relative stratigraphic hierarchy. The volcanoes studied here were active only in the Early Miocene. With few exceptions, most were active by 22 Ma and extinct by 16 Ma, with many extinct by 19 Ma. There was no pattern in their order of inception or extinction, although a few became dominant, burying or surrounding their neighbours. At the south-eastern end of the chain there is a rapid change over a short distance in both age and orientation, from the northwest trending Early Miocene volcanism in the Northland Basin to north-east trending Middle and Late Miocene volcanism in the contiguous Taranaki Basin. The Northland volcanoes are interpreted to have been an arc facing the south-westwards subducting South Fiji Basin, whereas the Taranaki volcanoes are interpreted to have been part of a separate, Pacific-facing volcanic arc-the Lau-Colville Ridge. \textcopyright{} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We also show that the accuracy of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations can be improved simultaneously. In addition, unlike in standard nested sampling, more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer. Popular standard nested sampling implementations can be easily adapted to perform dynamic nested sampling, and several dynamic nested sampling software packages are now publicly available.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technology are facilitating the deployment of sensors into the environment that can produce measurements at high spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Not only can these data be used to better characterize systems for improved modeling, but they can also be used to produce better understandings of the mechanisms of environmental processes. One such use of these data is anomaly detection to identify data that deviate from historical patterns. These anomalous data can be caused by sensor or data transmission errors or by infrequent system behaviors that are often of interest to the scientific or public safety communities. Thus, anomaly detection has many practical applications, such as data quality assurance and control (QA/QC), where anomalous data are treated as data errors; focused data collection, where anomalous data indicate segments of data that are of interest to researchers; and event detection, where anomalous data signal system behaviors that could result in a natural disaster. This study develops two automated anomaly detection methods that employ Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). These machine learning methods can operate on a single sensor data stream, or they can consider several data streams at once, using all of the streams concurrently to perform coupled anomaly detection. This study investigates these methods' abilities, using both coupled and uncoupled detection, to perform QA/QC on two windspeed data streams from Corpus Christi, Texas; false positive and false negative rates serve as the basis for comparison of the methods. The results indicate that a coupled DBN anomaly detector, tracking the actual windspeeds, their measurements, and the status of these measurements, performs well at identifying erroneous data in these data streams.},

  abstract = {Results are presented of new theoretical investigations in which spin waves in multilayered structures are calculated, properly including both magnetic interface anisotropies and exchange.1 The work is an extension of a recently introduced theory for the calculation of single-\dbend layer spin-\dbend wave frequencies by Rado and Hicken, including interface anisotropies and exchange.2 The calculations were carried out for two different types of multilayered structures, i.e., for multilayers consisting of alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic multilayers, and for all-magnetic multilayers. In both cases all layers were of the same thickness. The solutions were obtained by solving for the Maxwell equations and the Landau\textendash Lifshitz torque equation. The boundary conditions consist of the Maxwell boundary conditions, and the Rado\textendash Weertman boundary condition3 in the case of magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers. In the case of all-magnetic multilayers, modified Rado\textendash Weertman boundary conditions were used.4,5 In the case of magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers, both dipolar-type (Damon\textendash Eshbach-type) modes and exchange-dominated modes are obtained. The dipolar modes are frequency split as a result of the dipolar coupling of single-layer spin waves across the nonmagnetic spacer layers. The exchange modes show no frequency splitting apart from the crossing regimes with the dipolar modes. In the regime of small layer thicknesses, where the dipolar modes are well frequency separated from the exchange modes, the calculations reproduce results obtained by neglecting exchange contributions.6 In the limit of very small layer thicknesses ({$<$}40 \AA ), the influence of interface anisotropies manifests itself for the dipolar modes in a frequency increase, as well as in a reduced coupling across the nonmagnetic layers. In the crossing regimes of dipolar modes and exchange modes, the modes exchange their mode characteristics, leading to a pronounced frequency gap. The width of the gap is mostly determined by the amount of interface anisotropy. The calculation of an all-magnetic multilayered structure, consisting of three Fe layers with interleaving Ni layers, was carried in the limit of maximum exchange coupling across the interfaces.1 The results show frequency splittings both for dipolar modes and for exchange modes. In the limit of an infinite number of layers, the exchange modes will eventually form a band of exchange-dominated collective spin waves reminiscent of the band of collective dipolar spin waves in magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers. The crossing regimes of dipolar modes with the exchange modes show frequency gaps close to those observed for magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers. \textcopyright{} 1988, American Institute of Physics.

  abstract = {Background: Scientists monitoring active volcanoes are increasingly required to provide decision support to civil authorities during periods of unrest. As the extent and resolution of monitoring improves, the process of jointly interpreting multiple strands of indirect evidence becomes increasingly complex. Similarities with uncertainties in medical diagnosis suggest a formal evidence-based approach, whereby monitoring data are analysed synoptically to provide probabilistic hazard forecasts. A statistical tool to formalize such inferences is the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). By explicitly representing conditional dependencies between the volcanological model and observations, BBNs use probability theory to treat uncertainties in a rational and auditable manner, as warranted by the strength of the scientific evidence. A retrospective analysis is given for the 1976 Guadeloupe crisis, using a BBN to provide inferential assessment of the state of the evolving magmatic system and probability of incipient eruption. Conditional dependencies are characterized quantitatively by structured expert elicitation. Results: Analysis of the available monitoring data suggests that at the height of the crisis the probability of magmatic intrusion was high, in accordance with scientific thinking at the time. The corresponding probability of magmatic eruption was elevated in July and August 1976 and signs of precursory activity were justifiably cause for concern. However, collective uncertainty about the future course of the crisis was also substantial. Of all the possible scenarios, the most likely outcome evinced by interpretation of observations on 31 August 1976 was 'no eruption' (mean probability 0.5); the chance of a magmatic eruption/blast had an estimated mean probability of \textasciitilde 0.4. There was therefore no evidential basis for asserting one scenario to be significantly more likely than another. Conclusions: Our analysis adds objective probabilistic expression to the volcanological narrative at the time of the 1976 crisis, and demonstrates that a formal evidential case could have supported the authorities' concerns about public safety and decision to evacuate. Revisiting the episode highlights many challenges for modern, contemporary decision making under conditions of considerable uncertainty, and suggests the BBN is a suitable framework for marshalling multiple, uncertain observations, model results and interpretations. The formulation presented here can be developed as a tool for ongoing use in the volcano observatory.},

Each indicator follows a Bernoulli distribution and the individual probabilities of success vary. When all success probabilities are equal, the Poisson binomial distribution is a binomial distribution. The Poisson binomial distribution has many applications in different areas such as reliability, actuarial science, survey sampling, econometrics, etc. The computing of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the Poisson binomial distribution, however, is not straightforward. Approximation methods such as the Poisson approximation and normal approximations have been used in literature. Recursive formulae also have been used to compute the cdf in some areas. In this paper, we present a simple derivation for an exact formula with a closed-form expression for the cdf of the Poisson binomial distribution. The derivation uses the discrete Fourier transform of the characteristic function of the distribution. We develop an algorithm that efficiently implements the exact formula. Numerical studies were conducted to study the accuracy of the developed algorithm and approximation methods. We also studied the computational efficiency of different methods. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the use of different methods in practice and some suggestions for practitioners.},

  abstract = {A miniaturized, lightweight and low-cost UV correlation spectrometer, the FLYSPEC, has been developed as an alternative for the COSPEC, which has long been the mainstay for monitoring volcanic sulfur dioxide fluxes. Field experiments have been conducted with the FLYSPEC at diverse volcanic systems, including Masaya (Nicaragua), Po\'as (Costa Rica), Stromboli, Etna and Vulcano (Italy), Villarica (Chile) and Kilauea (USA). We present here those validation measurements that were made simultaneously with COSPEC at Kilauea between March 2002 and February 2003. These experiments, with source emission rates that ranged from 95 to 1,560 t d-1, showed statistically identical results from both instruments. SO2 path-concentrations ranged from 0 to {$>$}1,000 ppm-m with average correlation coefficients greater than r2=0.946. The small size and low cost create the opportunity for FLYSPEC to be used in novel deployment modes that have the potential to revolutionize the manner in which volcanic and industrial monitoring is performed. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

We introduce a stochastic dynamical system in which the parameter-to-data map is embedded, with the goal of employing techniques from nonlinear Kalman filtering to estimate the parameter given the data. The extended Kalman filter (which we refer to as ExKI in the context of inverse problems) can be effective for some inverse problems approached this way, but is impractical when the forward map is not readily differentiable and is given as a black box, and also for high dimensional parameter spaces because of the need to propagate large covariance matrices. Application of ensemble Kalman filters, for example use of the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithm, has emerged as a useful tool which overcomes both of these issues: it is derivative free and works with a low-rank covariance approximation formed from the ensemble. In this paper, we work with the ExKI, EKI, and a variant on EKI which we term unscented Kalman inversion (UKI).},

  abstract = {The Okataina Volcanic Centre (OVC) is the most recently active rhyolitic volcanic centre in the Taup\=o Volcanic Zone, Aotearoa New Zealand. Although best known for its high rates of explosive rhyolitic volcanism, there are numerous examples of basaltic to basaltic-andesite contributions to OVC eruptions, ranging from minor involvement of basalt in rhyolitic eruptions to the exclusively basaltic 1886 C.E. Plinian eruption of Tarawera. To explore the basaltic component supplying this dominantly rhyolitic area, we analyse the textures and compositions (minerals and melt inclusions) of four basaltic eruptions within the OVC that have similar whole rock chemistry, namely: Terrace Rd, Rotomakariri, Rotokawau, and Tarawera. Data from these basaltic deposits provide constraints on the conditions of magma evolution and ascent in the crust prior to eruption, revealing that at least five different magma types (two basalts, two dacites, one rhyolite) are sampled during basaltic eruptions. The most abundant basaltic magma type is generated by cooling-induced crystallisation of a common, oxidised, basaltic melt at various depths throughout the crust. The volatile content of this melt was increased by protracted fluid-undersaturated crystallisation. All eruptions display abundant evidence for syn-eruptive mixing of the different magma types. Rotomakariri, consisting of a mafic crystal cargo mixed into a dacitic magma is the most extreme example of this process. Despite similar bulk compositions, comparable to other basaltic deposits in the region, these four OVC eruptions are texturally distinct as a consequence of their wide variation in eruption style.},

  abstract = {Bathymetric observations of Ruapehu Crater Lake show that it became shallower and its volume decreased by 3 \texttimes{} 106 m3 between 1965 and 1970. It is likely that this was due to lava moving upwards in the region under the lake. From the regular measurements of Crater Lake temperature, outflow, and chloride and magnesium ion concentrations, the inflows of steam, cold water and chloride and magnesium ions were calculated, using the 1970 volume. Only about half the precipitation falling on and around the lake mixes with the lake water, since the cold fresh water floats on top of the denser lake water, and travels to the outlet without mixing with the main body of water in the lake. The chloride content of the input steam appears to vary with time, in a similar fashion to that of White Island fumaroles. Temperature and density profiles of the lake in 1965 and 1966 indicated that convection was occurring. The temperature profile of the top 175 m of the lake agreed with a model of turbulent convection in small cells, giving a temperature gradient at any level in the lake proportional to the heat flux at that level. The convection model predicted that the temperature at depth would exceed the local boiling point if the thermal power input reached a value which would sustain a surface temperature approaching 60\textdegree C. This prediction of instability was not inconsistent with observations. Convection in the present Crater Lake probably occurs in the form of thermal plumes from small sources. \textcopyright{} 1981.},

  abstract = {Regular observations of temperature, outflow rates and water chemistry of Crater Lake, Mt. Ruapehu, New Zealand have been made for the last 25 years. These data have been used to derive a model of the dynamics of the lake, and determine the input of energy, mass, and chloride from the volcano to the Crater Lake. The recent, relatively quiescent state of the volcano, when virtually no heat has been input to the lake, has also enabled an assessment to be made of the surface heat loss characteristics, which play an important role in the model of the lake. The modelling suggests that since about 1982 the ratio of the volcanic heat to mass added to the base of the lake is about 6 MJ/kg, which is not compatible with heating of the lake by magmatic steam alone. Thus, only about 50\% of the heating has been by magmatic steam. It is suggested that heat could be transferred from a magmatic source to the region below the lake by a heat-pipe mechanism, commonly associated with geothermal systems. The simultaneous upward movement of vapour phase, and downward movement of liquid phase from condensed vapour allows efficient heat transfer without overall mass transfer. The permeability necessary to supply the required heat is of the order of 10 darcy, and is consistent with a rubble filled vent. For at least the last five years, there has been a characteristic pattern in the Crater Lake temperature record, with alternate heating and cooling phases. The heating phase generally lasts for one or two months, while the cooling phase lasts for six months to a year. A possible explanation for this cyclic behaviour is the presence of a layer of liquid sulphur under Crater Lake, acting as a partial barrier between the heat-pipe and the lake. The unusual variations of the viscosity of liquid sulphur with temperature will mean that at temperatures greater than 160\textdegree C, the layer of sulphur becomes highly viscous and would block any upwards steam flow and hence stop the heat input to Crater Lake, so producing a cooling phase.

  abstract = {Some months prior to the 1995 eruption of Mt Ruapehu (New Zealand),\textbackslash na series of shallow earthquake swarms occurred about 15-20 km west\textbackslash nof the summit of Ruapehu. Several earthquakes in these swarms were\textbackslash nfelt, and the largest event was M-L 4.8. Cmstal earthquakes of M-L\textbackslash ngreater than or equal to 3.0 within 20 km of the summit of Ruapehu\textbackslash nhave been rather uncommon in recent years. Furthermore, the two periods\textbackslash nof strongest activity were both just before times when the temperature\textbackslash nof Crater Lake showed rapid increases. The second of these rapid\textbackslash nheating phases was immediately followed by increases in the Mg2+\textbackslash nion concentration in Crater Lake, indicating that chemical interactions\textbackslash nwere occurring between fresh magmatic material and the lake water.\textbackslash nThe coincidence between seismicity and lake changes suggested a link\textbackslash nwith the following eruption. A 1-D simultaneous inversion to locate\textbackslash nthe earthquakes more accurately showed that most of the earthquakes\textbackslash nfell into three spatial clusters, each cluster having a small horizontal\textbackslash ncross-section. The predominant depth was about 10-16 km. The b-value\textbackslash nof this swarm was 0.74, quite compatible with ordinary tectonic earthquakes.\textbackslash nEach cluster of earthquakes lies close to the normal Raurimu Fault\textbackslash nwhich runs predominantly north-south to the west of Ruapehu, with\textbackslash nan east-trending branch splaying off near its northern end (see Fig.\textbackslash n1b). Composite focal mechanisms of events in the two more southern\textbackslash nclusters are oblique-normal, while the other cluster to the north\textbackslash nhas an oblique-reverse mechanism. The two oblique-normal mechanisms\textbackslash nsuggest that extension has occurred on part of the fault. This stress\textbackslash npattern was also observed in the focal mechanism solutions of events\textbackslash nthat occurred after the eruption, when a denser network of portable\textbackslash nseismographs covered the region. Although we cannot definitely connect\textbackslash nthe occurrence of these swarms to the eruptions later in 1995, there\textbackslash nis a strong suggestion that the seismicity was connected to the process\textbackslash nof magma movement, which temperature and chemical changes in Crater\textbackslash nLake suggest was occurring during the first half of 1995.

A 1998 sequence at Haroharo with a largest event of ML 4.8, and a 2004 sequence near Lake Rotoehu (largest event ML 5.4), had normal b-values, and displayed an aftershock decay pattern, with most of the activity within the first few days. In contrast, a 2005 sequence a few tens of kilometres away at Matata (largest event ML 4.1), had very different characteristics, with a slow development and decay, no tendency for enhanced seismicity after the larger events, and a very high b-value. The focal mechanisms of the Rotoehu and Matata events are normal, and have stress patterns consistent with the geodetically observed extension of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in a northwest\textendash southeast direction. The extensive recent volcanism in the Okataina Volcanic Centre does not seem to have affected the stress pattern in this area. The Rotoehu sequence showed a strong resemblance, particularly in the time distribution of events, to the well-known swarm activity in the Vogtland region on the German/Czech border, in which larger events were followed by a burst of seismicity, as in a normal aftershock sequence. Some of the arguments that have been advanced to explain the Vogtland swarm as seismicity induced by fluid injection apply to Rotoehu, but there is no direct evidence of fluid involvement. The Matata sequence appears to have a continuing trigger mechanism, either a slow injection of fluid, or a slow slip event, in an environment in which opening pore spaces prevent high overpressures developing. The Matata sequence occurred close to the area of the 1987 ML 6.3 Edgecumbe Earthquake, so exhibiting two extremes of seismic temporal pattern, namely mainshock\textendash aftershock and a swarm with many events of similar magnitude, within a small area.},

This is a part of the development of a probabilistic volcanic hazard model (PVHM) for New Zealand, for hazards planning and insurance purposes. We use an established program (ASHFALL) to model individual eruptions, where the likely thickness of ash deposited at selected sites depends on the location of the volcano, eruptive volume, column height and ash size, and the wind conditions. A Monte Carlo procedure allows us to simulate the variations in eruptive volume and in wind conditions by analysing repeat eruptions, each time allowing the parameters to vary randomly according to known or assumed distributions. Actual wind velocity profiles are used, with randomness included by selection of a starting date. This method can handle the effects of multiple volcanic sources, each source with its own characteristics. We accumulate the tephra thicknesses from all sources to estimate the combined ashfall hazard, expressed as the frequency with which any given depth of tephra is likely to be deposited at selected sites. These numbers are expressed as annual probabilities or as mean return periods. We can also use this method for obtaining an estimate of how often and how large the eruptions from a particular volcano have been. Results from sediment cores in Auckland give useful bounds for the likely total volumes erupted from Egmont Volcano (Mt. Taranaki), 280 km away, during the last 130,000 years.},

Measurements in 2010 using a weather station on a buoy floating in Ruapehu Crater Lake enabled us to derive a relation between wind velocity above the lake and that measured at nearby weather stations, as well as providing direct evidence of the effect of the warm lake on the air above it. This supported the use of evaporation equations that allowed for the changing air conditions as incoming air became warmer and wetter from interaction with the lake, so decreasing the overall evaporation rate. Heat and mass balance calculations using these parameters and equations during the period 2003 to early 2007, as Crater Lake filled before it overflowed, confirm the previously observed high ratio of total heat flow to steam volume.},

This catalog consists of phase picks, hypocenters, and magnitudes. We present the history of the SCSN and the evolution of the catalog, to facilitate user understanding of its limitations and strengths. Hypocenters and magnitudes have improved in quality with time, as the number of stations has increased gradually from 7 to 400 and the data acquisition and measuring procedures have become more sophisticated. The magnitude of completeness (Mc of the network has improved from Mc 3:25 in the early years to Mc 1:8 at present, or better in the most densely instrumented areas. Mainshockaftershock and swarm sequences and scattered individual background earthquakes characterize the seismicity of more than 470,000 events. The earthquake frequency-size distribution has an average b-value of 1:0, with M 6:0 events occurring approximately every 3 yrs. The three largest earthquakes recorded were 1952 Mw 7.5 Kern County, 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers, and 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine sequences, and the three most damaging earthquakes were the 1933 Mw 6.4 Long Beach, 1971 Mw 6.7 San Fernando, and 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquakes. All of these events ruptured slow-slipping faults, located away from the main plate boundary fault, the San Andreas fault. Their aftershock sequences constitute about a third of the events in the catalog. The fast slipping southern San Andreas fault is relatively quiet at the microseismic level and has not had an M {$>$}6 earthquake since 1932. In contrast, the slower San Jacinto fault has the highest level of seismicity, including several M {$>$}6 events. Thus, the spatial and temporal seismicity patterns exhibit a complex relationship with the plate tectonic crustal deformation.},

  abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was introduced by Evensen in 1994 (Evensen 1994 J. Geophys. Res. 99 10143\textendash 62) as a novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A. In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.},

  abstract = {Taup\=o volcano, New Zealand, is a large caldera volcano that has been highly active through the Holocene. It most recently erupted {$\sim$}1800 years ago but there have been multiple periods of historic volcanic unrest. We use seismological and geodetic analysis to show that in 2019 Taup\=o underwent a period of unrest characterised by increased seismic activity through multiple swarms and was accompanied by ground deformation within the caldera. The earthquakes, which include non-double-couple events, serve to outline an aseismic zone beneath the most recent eruptive vents. This aseismic zone is coincident with an inflating source, based on forward modelling of ground deformation data. We infer that this aseismic and deforming region delineates the location of the present day magma reservoir that is {$\geq$}250 km3 in volume and has a melt fraction of {$>$} 20\textendash 30\%, inhibiting seismic activity. Our analysis shows that the 2019 unrest at Taup\=o was volcanic in nature and origin, demonstrating that this is an active and potentially hazardous volcano, and that improving our monitoring and understanding of its behaviour is important.},

Thus, quantitative analysis of these systems depends mainly on numerical solution of coupled partial differential equations and complementary equations of state (EOS). The past 2 decades have seen steady growth of computational power and the development of numerical models that have eliminated or minimized the need for various simplifying assumptions. Considerable heuristic insight has been gained from process-oriented numerical modeling. Recent modeling efforts employing relatively complete EOS and accurate transport calculations have revealed dynamic behavior that was damped by linearized, less accurate models, including fluid property control of hydrothermal plume temperatures and three-dimensional geometries. Other recent modeling results have further elucidated the controlling role of permeability structure and revealed the potential for significant hydrothermally driven deformation. Key areas for future research include incorporation of accurate EOS for the complete H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, more realistic treatment of material heterogeneity in space and time, realistic description of large-scale relative permeability behavior, and intercode benchmarking comparisons.},

The deep convolutional network generator is calculated as the solution of a regularized inverse problem. We show that this approach also applies to time-series and audio synthesis, thus providing an alternative to recurrent neural networks and wavenets.

  abstract = {Seismo-volcano source localization is essential to improve our understanding of eruptive dynamics and of magmatic systems. The lack of clear seismic wave phases prohibits the use of classical location methods. Seismic antennas composed of one-component (1C) seismometers provide a good estimate of the backazimuth of the wavefield. The depth estimation, on the other hand, is difficult or impossible to determine. As in classical seismology, the use of three-component (3C) seismometers is now common in volcano studies. To determine the source location parameters (backazimuth and depth), we extend the 1C seismic antenna approach to 3Cs. This paper discusses a high-resolution location method using a 3C array survey (3C-MUSIC algorithm) with data from two seismic antennas installed on an andesitic volcano in Peru (Ubinas volcano). One of the main scientific questions related to the eruptive process of Ubinas volcano is the relationship between the magmatic explosions and long-period (LP) swarms. After introducing the 3C array theory, we evaluate the robustness of the location method on a full wavefield 3-D synthetic data set generated using a digital elevation model of Ubinas volcano and an homogeneous velocity model. Results show that the backazimuth determined using the 3C array has a smaller error than a 1C array. Only the 3C method allows the recovery of the source depths. Finally, we applied the 3C approach to two seismic events recorded in 2009. Crossing the estimated backazimuth and incidence angles, we find sources located 1000 {$\pm$} 660 m and 3000 {$\pm$} 730 m below the bottom of the active crater for the explosion and the LP event, respectively. Therefore, extending 1C arrays to 3C arrays in volcano monitoring allows a more accurate determination of the source epicentre and now an estimate for the depth.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the excitation of continuous ground vibration at geothermal areas and active volcanoes, which is based on the instability of water/steam two-phase flow. Through a series of numerical experiments, we evaluate the amplitude and period of ground vibrations excited by density wave oscillation (called 'DWO'), one of the flow-instability phenomena, which is known in the nuclear reactor engineering to occur under a wide variety of boundary conditions. We consider a vertical cylindrical pipe buried underground and 1-D flows through it driven by the lithostatic pressure gradient. Water flows into the pipe from below and is evaporated by the heat supplied from outside. When the heating rate is low, after a perturbation such as a change in heating rate is given to the flow system, a decaying oscillation of pressure, flow velocity and void fraction occurs being followed by a stationary flow. On the other hand, when the heating rate exceeds a threshold, the perturbation grows to a continuous oscillation with a fixed amplitude, forming a limit cycle DWO. We investigate how various parameters such as pipe length, pressure and heating rate, affect the stability of the two-phase flow. We then estimate the amplitudes of seismic waves excited by DWO, assuming that the pipe is embedded in a elastic half-space. We find that a longer pipe can excite a DWO of longer period and of larger maximum amplitude. For a pipe of length of 100 m with its bottom at the depth of 150 m, the DWO period is nearly 10 s. In this case the maximum pipe diameter for the excitation of limit cycle DWO for reasonable rates of stationary conductive heat supply from country rocks to the two-phase mixture inside the pipe (less than about 35 MW m-3) is 0.02 m. The maximum amplitudes of ground displacement due to DWO are of the order of 7 \texttimes{} 10-8 m 4 \texttimes{} 10-9 m at epicentral distances of 200 and 1000 m, respectively. Typical geothermal areas and active volcanoes can supply heat and discharged water mass, which are required to excite DWO larger than typical background noises. Therefore, DWO due to a shallow water/ steam flow could excite ground motions with periods longer than 10 s which is large enough to be observed with suitably designed broadband seismic experiments at geothermal fields. \textcopyright{} 2005 RAS.},

However, the observed seismic properties of lower crust and upper mantle in oceanic island arcs differ significantly from those in the continental crust. Accordingly, significant modifications of lower arc crust must occur, if continental crust is indeed formed from island arcs. Here we investigate how the seismic characteristics of arc crust are transformed into those of the continental crust by calculating the density and seismic structure of two exposed sections of island arc (Kohistan and Talkeetna). The Kohistan crustal section is negatively buoyant with respect to the underlying depleted upper mantle at depths exceeding 40 kilometres and is characterized by a steady increase in seismic velocity similar to that observed in active arcs. In contrast, the lower Talkeetna crust is density sorted, preserving only relicts (about ten to a hundred metres thick) of rock with density exceeding that of the underlying mantle. Specifically, the foundering of the lower Talkeetna crust resulted in the replacement of dense mafic and ultramafic cumulates by residual upper mantle, producing a sharp seismic discontinuity at depths of around 38 to 42\,kilometres, characteristic of the continental Mohorovi\v{c}i\'c discontinuity (the Moho). Dynamic calculations indicate that foundering is an episodic process that occurs in most arcs with a periodicity of half a million to five million years. Moreover, because foundering will continue after arc magmatism ceases, this process ultimately results in the formation of the continental Moho.},

Intragranular cracks and slip along grain contacts release energy as elastic waves termed acoustic emissions (AE). AEs are thought to contain predictive information that can be used for fault failure forecasting. Here, we present a method using unsupervised classification and an attention network to forecast labquakes using AE waveform features. Our data were generated in a laboratory setting using a biaxial shearing device with granular fault gouge intended to mimic the conditions of tectonic faults. Here, we analyzed the temporal evolution of AEs generated throughout several hundred laboratory earthquake cycles. We used a Conscience Self-Organizing Map (CSOM) to perform topologically ordered vector quantization based on waveform properties. The resulting map was used to interactively cluster AEs. We examined the clusters over time to identify those with predictive ability. Finally, we used a variety of LSTM and attention-based networks to test the predictive power of the AE clusters. By tracking cumulative waveform features over the seismic cycle, the network is able to forecast the time-to-failure (TTF) of lab earthquakes. Our results show that analyzing the data to isolate predictive signals and using a more sophisticated network architecture are key to robustly forecasting labquakes. In the future, this method could be applied on tectonic faults to monitor earthquakes and augment early warning systems.},

  abstract = {Volcanic ash is one of the farthest-reaching volcanic hazards and ash produced by large magnitude explosive eruptions has the potential to affect communities over thousands of kilometres. Quantifying the hazard from ash fall is problematic, in part because of data limitations that make eruption characteristics uncertain but also because, given an eruption, the distribution of ash is then controlled by time and altitude-varying wind conditions. Any one location may potentially be affected by ash falls from one, or a number of, volcanoes so that volcano-specific studies may not fully capture the ash fall hazard for communities in volcanically active areas. In an attempt to deal with these uncertainties, this paper outlines a probabilistic framework for assessing ash fall hazard on a regional scale. The methodology employs stochastic simulation techniques and is based upon generic principles that could be applied to any area, but is here applied to the Asia-Pacific region. Average recurrence intervals for eruptions greater than or equal to Volcanic Explosivity Index 4 were established for 190 volcanoes in the region, based upon the eruption history of each volcano and, where data were lacking, the averaged eruptive behaviour of global analogous volcanoes. Eruption histories are drawn from the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program catalogue of Holocene events and unpublished data, with global analogues taken from volcanoes of the same type category: Caldera, Large Cone, Shield, Lava dome or Small Cone. Simulated are 190,000 plausible eruption scenarios, with ash dispersal for each determined using an advection\textendash diffusion model and local wind conditions. Key uncertainties are described by probability distributions. Modelled results include the annual probability of exceeding given ash thicknesses, summed over all eruption scenarios and volcanoes. A companion paper describes the results obtained for the Asia-Pacific region},

  abstract = {Advances in machine learning (ML) techniques and computational capacity have yielded state-of-the-art methodologies for processing, sorting, and analyzing large seismic data sets. In this work, we consider an application of ML for automatically identifying dominant types of impulsive seismicity contained in observations from a 34-station broadband seismic array deployed on the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), Antarctica from 2014 to 2017. The RIS seismic data contain signals and noise generated by many glaciological processes that are useful for monitoring the integrity and dynamics of ice shelves. Deep clustering was employed to efficiently investigate these signals. Deep clustering automatically groups signals into hypothetical classes without the need for manual labeling, allowing for comparison of their signal characteristics and spatial and temporal distribution with potential source mechanisms. The method uses spectrograms as input and encodes their salient features into a lower-dimensional latent representation using an autoencoder, a type of deep neural network. For comparison, two clustering methods are applied to the latent data: a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deep embedded clustering (DEC). Eight classes of dominant seismic signals were identified and compared with environmental data such as temperature, wind speed, tides, and sea ice concentration. The greatest seismicity levels occurred at the RIS front during the 2016 El Ni\~no summer, and near grounding zones near the front throughout the deployment. We demonstrate the spatial and temporal association of certain classes of seismicity with seasonal changes at the RIS front, and with tidally driven seismicity at Roosevelt Island.},

  abstract = {Mt. Ruapehu erupted on 25 September 2007 at 20:26 PM NZDT (8:26 UT) generating a steam column to about 15,000 ft (4600 m), a directed ballistic and surge deposit of coarse blocks and ash to the north of the Crater Lake, and initiated lahars in the Whangaehu catchment and Whakapapa ski field. The eruption was recorded on three broadband seismometers and two acoustic pressure sensors which indicated broadly coherent waveform characteristics across the network. The eruption had a duration of less than 1 min as indicated by strong seismic and acoustic pulses. The acoustic wave coincided with observed very long-period (VLP) seismic signal (2-25 s period). The acoustic pulse had a positive pressure (indicating an explosion) and travelled at a velocity of ??? 320 m/s. The syn-eruptive VLP was composed of surface waves having strong radial and transverse components. The immediate aftermath of the eruption produced about 4 min of continued high amplitude spasmodic tremor signals that probably resulted from post-explosion phase associated vent backfill/stabilisation. The eruption was preceded by minor volcano-tectonic earthquakes and tremor bursts which began 10 min before the main eruption. Two smaller VLP signals were associated with these tremor pulses at 20:17 and 20:25. These pre-eruptive VLP signals had particle motions indicating body and surface waves from a sub-surface source region. Modelling of the VLP sources using a 3D finite-difference method shows that that the pre-eruption VLP signals are consistent with a volume fluctuation at 3-7 km depth from a radially symmetric source. The main eruption VLP was consistent with a south and downward directed single force in response to a northward directed jet and northward directed ballistic deposits. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The mathematical model that relates the arrival times to the wave speed is assumed to be the Eikonal equation. Typically the measured arrival time data is noisy so that in turn the recovered wave speed is noisy. Here we assume the noise in the measured arrival times is Gaussian and show that then the recovered wave speed has noise that has an inverse Rician distribution. This latter distribution has infinite variance. Nevertheless, we show using the Kantorovich metric that for small variances in the Gaussian noise (corresponding to a small value of the shape parameter in the Rician random variable), the inverse Rician distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose mean is the true wave speed.},

  abstract = {The impact of pictorial knowledge representation is demonstrated for two examples of time series analysis in seismology. The approaches perform a) automated recognition of known event signatures and b) high-resolution onset timing of later phases. Both methods work well under extreme conditions of noise and achieved human-like performance in recognizing known situations. Crucial for this success of pictorial knowledge representation was the design of suitably scaled images. They must be simple and robust enough to transform the complexity of ``real life'' data into a limited set of patterns. These patterns differ significantly from the initial data; they correspond more closely to the non-linear weighting of recognized impressions by an experienced scientist. Thus we address the pictorial presentations as mental images. For both reported applications, part of their power comes by model-based image modifications. However, this enhancement is far from demanding a complete theory. Any fractional model already enhances the image adaptation, so mental images are best suited to deal with incomplete knowledge like any other artificial intelligence approach. Cognitive plausibility was found for both the non-linear image scalings and the model-based image modifications. In general, our way of pictorial knowledge representation conforms to the concept of mental images by Kosslyn. Any new task will demand the composition of new, dedicated image transformations where some generalized design criteria are derived from our applications. \textcopyright{} 1994 IEEE},

  abstract = {We process seismic broad-band data from southern Norway by cross correlation of ambient seismic noise in view of getting a better image of the crustal structure in the area. The main data set sterns from the temporary MAGNUS network which operated continuously from 2006 September to 2008 June. Additionally, data from permanent stations of the National Norwegian Seismic Network, the NORSAR array and GSN stations in the region are used. We compute vertical component cross-correlation functions using 41 receivers for 3-month time windows. Evaluation of the azimuthal and temporal variation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and f--k analysis of data from NORSAR array between 3 and 25 s period shows that the dominant source areas of seismic noise are located to the west and north of the network during most of the measurement time, which corresponds well to the Norwegian coast line. During summer months, the SNRs decrease but the azimuthal distribution becomes more uniform between 7 and 12 s period, suggesting a more diffuse character of the wavefield. Primary ocean microseisms above 12 s show different dominant source azimuths during this time period compared to the winter months. Time--frequency analysis is applied to measure Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves between each station pair for each 3-month correlation stack and the mean and variance of all dispersion curves is computed for each path. After rejection of low-quality data, a careful analysis shows that the group velocities are not biased by noise directionality. We invert the data for group velocity maps at period bands between 3 and 25 s. At short periods, we find an average Rayleigh wave group speed of about 3 km s-1 and velocity anomalies that correlate very well with local surface geology. While higher velocities (+5 per cent) can be associated with the Caledonian nappes in the central part of southern Norway, the Oslo Graben is reflected by negative velocity anomalies (-3 to -5 per cent). At longer periods, group velocities correlate well with the variation of Moho depths beneath southern Norway.},

From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations.

  abstract = {Earthquakes are traditionally located using travel times . However , since the ground-motion amplitude generally decays with the distance from the source , it should also be possible to locate earthquakes using amplitude data . Amplitudes are affected by m a n y factors other than the distance , so that we do not expect to be able to locate the epicenter , the location of the initial rupture , very accurately with amplitude data . However , locating earthquakes with amplitudes has its own merits : ( 1 ) For postearthquake emergency services , it is often more impor- tant to know the spatial distribution of strong-motion parameters such as peak acceleration and peak velocity than the rupture initiation point itself ( National Research Council , 1991 ). This is especially true for thrust earthquakes ( e . g ., 1971 San Fernando earthquake ; 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake ) or events with large rupture zones . ( 2 ) The amplitudes are usually much easier to determine than the arrival times , especially for events with complex rupture patterns or with immediate foreshocks in which event association can be difficult . For application to real-time earthquake information systems such as CUBE ( C a l t e c h / U S G S Broadcast of Earthquakes ; Kanamori et al ., 1991 ), the amplitude method could provide a quick and robust w a y to send useful informa- tion for emergency operations . Here , we report a few examples and propose a method for future implementation in a CUBE-type system . We use peak acceleration as the amplitude parameter . However , use of other parameters such as peak velocity and CAV ( EPRI , 1991 ) is equally possible . For simplicity , we use the peak acceleration-distance relation developed by Joyner and Boore ( 1981 ) to fit the observed data . This relation is given by where A is the peak horizontal acceleration in g , M is magnitude , and d is the closest distance to the surface projection of the fault rupture in kin . In our application , d is interpreted as the distance between the site and the " strong- motion centroid " ( SMC ) that is to be determined from the amplitude data . Since d is defined differently from Joyner and Boore ( 1981 ), the meaning of the magnitude M is also different . We fit the observed peak acceleration data with equation ( 1 ) and determine M , latitude ( \textasciitilde{} b ), and longitude ( A ) of the SMC . Equation ( 1 ) is nonlinear with respect to 4 ) and A . We scan the model p a r a m e t e r space ( M , \textasciitilde{} b , A ) to determine the approximate location of the global minimum of the error function . Then we use the values of M , \textcent{} , and \textbullet{} at that location as the first approximation to determine the final solution using the method of least-squares . This procedure is especially important for spotting an event located outside the network . We tested this method using the data for the 1989 Loma Prieta , 1991 Sierra Madre , 1992 J o s h u a Tree , 1992 Landers , and 1992 Big Bear earthquakes . The data used and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Figure l a shows the},

As the technology of seismic instrumentation, telemetry, computers, and data storage facility advances, the real-time seismology for rapid postearthquake notification is essentially established. Research for early warning is still underway. Two approaches are possible: (a) regional warning and (b) on-site (or site-specific) warning. In (a), the traditional seismological method is used to locate an earthquake, determine the magnitude, and estimate the ground motion at other sites. In (b), the beginning of the ground motion (mainly P wave) observed at a site is used to predict the ensuing ground motion at the same site. An effective approach to on-site warning is discussed in light of earthquake rupture physics.},

Continuous waveform data recorded between 2003 and 2009 with 788 broadband seismograph stations in Canada and adjacent regions were used in the analysis. The higher primary frequency band of the ambient noise provides better resolution of crustal structures than previous tomographic models based on earthquake waveforms. Prominent low velocity anomalies are observed at shallow depths ({$<$}20 km) beneath the Gulf of St. Lawrence in east Canada, the sedimentary basins of west Canada, and the Cordillera. In contrast, the Canadian Shield exhibits high crustal velocities. We characterize the crust-mantle transition in terms of not only its depth and velocity but also its sharpness, defined by its thickness and the amount of velocity increase. Considerable variations in the physical properties of the crust-mantle transition are observed across Canada. Positive correlations between the crustal thickness, Moho velocity, and the thickness of the transition are evident throughout most of the craton except near Hudson Bay where the uppermost mantle Vs is relatively low. Prominent vertical Vs gradients are observed in the midcrust beneath the Cordillera and beneath most of the Canadian Shield. The midcrust velocity contrast beneath the Cordillera may correspond to a detachment zone associated with high temperatures immediately beneath, whereas the large midcrust velocity gradient beneath the Canadian Shield probably represents an ancient rheological boundary between the upper and lower crust.

This work proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset\textendash twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The formal definition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems and control theory. The declarative and general nature of the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision-making is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight damage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data. The graphical model foundation ensures that the digital twin calibration and updating process is principled, unified and able to scale to an entire fleet of digital twins.},

These are multi-modular computer systems designed to deal with large and fast spatio/spectro temporal data using spiking neural networks (SNN) as major processing modules. ECOS and eSTDM in particular can learn incrementally from data streams, can include 'on the fly' new input variables, new output class labels or regression outputs, can continuously adapt their structure and functionality, can be visualised and interpreted for new knowledge discovery and for a better understanding of the data and the processes that generated it. eSTDM can be used for early event prediction due to the ability of the SNN to spike early, before whole input vectors (they were trained on) are presented. A framework for building eSTDM called NeuCube along with a design methodology for building eSTDM using this is presented. The implementation of this framework in MATLAB, Java, and PyNN (Python) is presented. The latter facilitates the use of neuromorphic hardware platforms to run the eSTDM. Selected examples are given of eSTDM for pattern recognition and early event prediction on EEG data, fMRI data, multisensory seismic data, ecological data, climate data, audio-visual data. Future directions are discussed, including extension of the NeuCube framework for building neurogenetic eSTDM and also new applications of eSTDM.},

  abstract = {1 This study is devoted to a systematic analysis of the state of stress of the central European Alps and northern Alpine foreland in Switzerland based on focal mechanisms of 138 earthquakes with magnitudes between 1 and 5. The most robust feature of the results is that the azimuth of the minimum compressive stress, S-3, is generally well constrained for all data subsets and always lies in the NE quadrant. However, within this quadrant, the orientation of S-3 changes systematically both along the structural strike of the Alpine chain and across it. The variation in stress along the mountain belt from NE to SW involves a progressive, counterclockwise rotation of S-3 and is most clear in the foreland, where it amounts to 45degrees - 50degrees. This pattern of rotation is compatible with the disturbance to the stress field expected from the indentation of the Adriatic Block into the central European Plate, possibly together with buoyancy forces arising from the strongly arcuate structure of the Moho to the immediate west of our study area. Across the Alps, the variation in azimuth of S-3 is defined by a progressive, counterclockwise rotation of about 45degrees from the foreland in the north across the Helvetic domain to the Penninic nappes in the south and is accompanied by a change from a slight predominance of strikeslip mechanisms in the foreland to a strong predominance of normal faulting in the high parts of the Alps. The observed rotation can be explained by the perturbation of the large-scale regional stress by a local uniaxial deviatoric tension with a magnitude similar to that of the regional differential stress and with an orientation perpendicular to the strike of the Alpine belt. The tensile nature and orientation of this stress is consistent with the "spreading'' stress expected from lateral density changes due to a crustal root beneath the Alps.},

In this study, hypocenter determinations were conducted using 3D travel-time tables (3D-TTs) to reflect travel times of a 3D inhomogeneous velocity structure in event locations, and the results were compared with those achieved using the 3D raytracing method. The use of 3D-TTs reduced the calculation time by a factor of about 1800 compared with the raytracing method. Whereas minor differences between interpolated travel times and the raytracing method caused some corresponding location differences, the travel-time table was effective for correction of hypocenter locations according to an inhomogeneous velocity-structure model.}

We have created detailed attenuation (Q Lg) and velocity (V Lg) models for the Northern Middle East based on the analysis of waveforms of regional seismic phase Lg from 3171 regional earthquakes recorded at 578 stations in Turkish and Iranian Plateaus and surrounding regions. The attenuation and velocity models are assumed to serve as proxies for the bulk average crustal shear wave attenuation (Q {$\beta$}) and velocities (V s). 31 232 reliable Lg spectra were collected and used to measure the two-station method (TSM) and reverse two-station/event method (RTM) Lg Q at 1 Hz (Q 0) and its frequency-dependence factor ({$\eta$}). The Lg Q 0 and {$\eta$} values are measured over the individual TSM and RTM paths and are then used to perform an LSQR tomographic inversion for lateral variations in Q 0 and {$\eta$}. The Lg Q 0 and {$\eta$} models both correlate well with the major tectonic boundaries in the region. The tomographic models as well as the individual TSM and RTM measurements show lower values of Lg Q 0 over the Turkish-Anatolian Plateau ({$<$}150) than those observed over the Iranian Plateau (150\textendash 400). Furthermore, we obtained the Lg group velocity model by inverting the time of the first arrival of the Lg waveform on each seismogram. Our Q measurements are strongly correlated with the measurements of Lg group velocity (V Lg) suggesting that the source of many of the low Q and velocity anomalies is likely the same. The regions where we see negative correlations are likely a result of Sn to Lg converted energy. Our results also have implications for the far field ground motions, suggesting that large earthquakes in eastern Iran could have a significant far field ground motions due to relatively low crustal attenuation within the Iranian plateau.}

  abstract = {Many models of earthquake faults have been introduced that connect Gutenberg-Richter (GR) scaling to triggering processes. However, natural earthquake fault systems are composed of a variety of different geometries and materials and the associated heterogeneity in physical properties can cause a variety of spatial and temporal behaviors. This raises the question of how the triggering process and the structure interact to produce the observed phenomena. Here we present a simple earthquake fault model based on the Olami-Feder-Christensen and Rundle-Jackson-Brown cellular automata models with long-range interactions that incorporates a fixed percentage of stronger sites, or asperity cells, into the lattice. These asperity cells are significantly stronger than the surrounding lattice sites but eventually rupture when the applied stress reaches their higher threshold stress. The introduction of these spatial heterogeneities results in temporal clustering in the model that mimics that seen in natural fault systems along with GR scaling. In addition, we observe sequences of activity that start with a gradually accelerating number of larger events (foreshocks) prior to a main shock that is followed by a tail of decreasing activity (aftershocks). This work provides further evidence that the spatial and temporal patterns observed in natural seismicity are strongly influenced by the underlying physical properties and are not solely the result of a simple cascade mechanism.},

The calculated vertical displacements are compared with seismic data collected at stations in North America, Greenland, Iceland and Europe. This modelling identifies a particularly energetic source area stretching from the Labrador Sea to south of Iceland, where wind patterns are especially conducive to generating oppositely travelling waves of same period, and the ocean depth is favourable for efficient microseism generation through the 'organ pipe' resonance of the compression waves, as predicted by the theory. This correspondence between observations and the model predictions demonstrates that deep ocean nonlinear wave\textendash wave interactions are sufficiently energetic to account for much of the observed seismic amplitudes in North America, Greenland and Iceland.},

The calculated vertical displacements are compared with seismic data collected at stations in North America, Greenland, Iceland and Europe. This modelling identifies a particularly energetic source area stretching from the Labrador Sea to south of Iceland, where wind patterns are especially conducive to generating oppositely travelling waves of same period, and the ocean depth is favourable for efficient microseism generation through the 'organ pipe' resonance of the compression waves, as predicted by the theory. This correspondence between observations and the model predictions demonstrates that deep ocean nonlinear wave-wave interactions are sufficiently energetic to account for much of the observed seismic amplitudes in North America, Greenland and Iceland. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

  abstract = {Over the last three years, a major international effort has been made by the Sub-Commission on Earthquake Algorithms of the International Association of Seismology and the Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) to generate new global traveltime tables for seismic phases to update the tables of Jeffreys \& Bullen (1940). The new tables are specifically designed for convenient computational use, with high-accuracy interpolation in both depth and range. The new iasp91 traveltime tables are derived from a radially stratified velocity model which has been constructed so that the times for the major seismic phases are consistent with the reported times for events in the catalogue of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) for the period 196420131987. The baseline for the P-wave traveltimes in the iasp91 model has been adjusted to provide only a small bias in origin time for well-constrained events at the main nuclear testing sites around the world. For P-waves at teleseismic distances, the new tables are about 0.7s slower than the 1968 P-tables (Herrin 1968) and on average about 1.820131.9 s faster than the Jeffreys \& Bullen (1940) tables. For S-waves the teleseismic times lie between those of the JB tables and the results of Randall (1971). Because the times for all phases are derived from the same velocity model, there is complete consistency between the traveltimes for different phases at different focal depths. The calculation scheme adopted for the new iasp91 tables is that proposed by Buland \& Chapman (1983). Tables of delay time as a function of slowness are stored for each traveltime branch, and interpolated using a specially designed tau spline which takes care of square-root singularities in the derivative of the traveltime curve at certain critical slownesses. With this representation, once the source depth is specified, it is straightforward to find the traveltime explicitly for a given epicentral distance. The computational cost is no higher than a conventional look-up table, but there is increased accuracy in constructing the traveltimes for a source at arbitrary depth. A further advantage over standard tables is that exactly the same procedure can be used for each phase. For a given source depth, it is therefore possible to generate very rapidly a comprehensive list of traveltimes and associated derivatives for the main seismic phases which could be observed at a given epicentral distance.},

  abstract = {The Maimon Formation consists largely of metavolcanic rocks with a small proportion of metasediments. Specific premetamorphic lithologic units that have been identified by a combination of field mapping, petrographic study, and chemical analyses include metabasalt (pyroxene-plagioclase and related mafic plagioclase porphyry), metadacite/metarhyolite (quartz porphyries), undivided metavolcanic rocks (largely plagioclase porphyry; probably metaandesite), and metasediments (including limestone [now marble], iron formation, and carbonaceous shale [now slate]). Although flows are common in the Maimon Formation, agglomerates and tuffs are also present. Rock types and textures suggest that most of the Maimon Formation volcanic rocks were emplaced in a submarine environment and that water depths increased to the southeast. Many rocks have undergone both seafloor and regional metamorphism, and much of the formation consists of the assemblage epidote-chlorite-albite. Less deformed zones throughout the Maimon Formation preserve remnant phenocrysts, and remnant pillows and amygdules are present in the northern part. Foliation, which apparently resulted from regional metamorphism, is widespread but is best developed in the northwestern part of the Maimon Formation, where actinolite is part of the metamorphic assemblage. The Maimon Formation is part of a belt of low-grade metamorphic rocks, including the Amina Schist, that crops out along the northern margin of the Cordillera Central. Whereas chemical compositions of the Maimon Formation support the interpretation that it consists largely of metavolcanic rocks that were altered by seafloor metamorphism, published chemical analyses for the Amina Schist are richer in CaO and could represent volcaniclastic metasediments. Neither the Maimon nor the Amina chemical analyses are as strongly bimodal as the Los Ranchos Formation, with which correlation has been suggested, and the types of mineral deposits in these formations also differ significantly. If these three units are coeval, they must have formed in different environments, with the Los Ranchos Formation forming on a seamount or other elevated seafloor, the Maimon Formation forming in a more typical oceanic island-arc setting, and the Amina Schists forming from detritus derived from these or other rocks.}

  abstract = {At 20:26 (NZDT) on 25 September 2007 a moderate gas-driven eruption beneath the summit Crater Lake of Mt. Ruapehu, New Zealand generated a directed ballistic fallout apron and surtseyan jet that impacted an area of c. 2.5 km2 to the north of the vent. Two climbers were caught in the blast at a hut 600 m from the vent. Primary, ice-slurry lahars were generated in two catchments draining the summit region, including a flow that entered a commercial ski field. The ejecta consists of blocks of andesitic lava and scoria erupted during previous volcanic episodes, a variety of mineral-cemented lake-floor sediments, vent-fill debris and rare glassy material interpreted to be derived from a fresh batch of magma. A minority of clasts contain formerly molten elemental sulphur, indicating that vent temperatures at the base of the lake were in excess of 119 \textdegree C. The ballistic deposit is confined to a c. 40\textdegree{} wide swath directed northwards that extends up to 2 km from the inferred vent location beneath Crater Lake. The strong directionality of the jetted deposits and ballistic-free 'shadow-zones' sheltered by intervening topography all point to a relatively low-angle directed blast. Previous similar eruptions at Ruapehu also show preferred deposit orientations that are here correlated with an inclined and off-centre vent beneath Crater Lake. The 25 September 2007 eruption appears to have resulted from failure of a relatively shallow hydrothermal seal composed of elemental sulphur and other mineral precipitates developed in the vent breccia, which breached following overpressurization by a pulse of magmatic gases released from deeper in the conduit. This event highlights the potential hazard from relatively minor gas-driven eruptions at Ruapehu that can occur with little or no warning. Improved understanding of the eruption mechanism for this style of eruption will inform future risk assessments for Ruapehu and other similar volcanoes worldwide. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Recent eruptions from Mt. Ruapehu have been difficult to predict, despite the presence of a multi-parametric monitoring network. As a result, it is necessary to assess precursory signals prior to an eruption and align those to magmatic processes at depth. Fortuitously, scoria from all historical Ruapehu eruptions contains pyroxene crystals that are strongly reversely zoned in the form of a thin (2 to 3{$\mu$}m), outermost rim. These crystals therefore preserved changes in the magmatic system soon before their eruption. We used experimentally determined diffusion coefficients to assess the timescales of magma\textendash magma interaction, and compared those to the monitoring record. Four of the five eruptions analysed (1969, 1971, 1977, 1995) gave diffusion timescales \textasciitilde 3 to 5months before their eruption, with an increased number of crystals recording timescales within 1month of eruption. Pyroxene crystals from the 1996 eruption record events that occurred prior to and during the 1995 eruption suggesting that the bulk of the 1996 crystals was derived from the 1995 magma. These diffusion timescales do not compare well to a change in any monitoring signal before historical eruptions. However, an examination of recent seismicity (2005\textendash 2013) since a significant upgrade (both in number of stations and type of seismometers) showed that two phreatic eruptions in 2006 and 2007 were preceded by a seismic swarm from \textasciitilde 5 to 15km depth, \textasciitilde 3 to 5months before each eruption \textemdash{} consistent with the diffusion timescales. Based on this correlation, deep seismic swarms likely indicate a period of pressurisation in the magmatic system, which may lead to gas-rich, phreatic eruptions.},

Since the late 1960s, volcanic activity has alternated between quiescence, unrest, and eruption on short timescales. For this review we compiled extensive observational records, examined the rich scientific literature, and use newly acquired data, to understand the broad volcanic history and system dynamics. Based on recent bathymetry data, we propose a distinction exists between the Whakaari edifice and Te Paepae o Aotea/Volkner Rocks, which were previously considered to be part of the same edifice. Geochemical analyses of scoria samples from the island have been used to build a magma system model where dominantly andesitic-dacitic magma is periodically intruded by basalt. More dynamic processes are recorded in the hydrothermal system, where the location and activity of fumarolic features have been ephemeral and the crater lake has varied in scale over short time intervals. Eruptions of the dominantly andesitic magma have historically been small and range from phreatomagmatic through to magmatic, largely depositing ash and scoria to a restricted distance that is confined to the main crater floor. Phreatic eruptions are the most common eruption style, based on recently observed and monitored activity.},

  abstract = {Presented in this paper is an algorithm to compute the exact Voronoi diagram of circle set from the Voronoi diagram of point set. In particular, the topology aspect of the algorithm is presented here. The circles are located in a two dimensional Euclidean space, the radii of circles are not necessarily equal, and the circles are allowed to intersect. Even though the time complexity is O(n\^2), the algorithm turns out to be fast and robust. The algorithm uses the topology of the point set Voronoi diagram as an initial solution, and finds the correct topology of the Voronoi diagram of circle set from its point set counterpart. Hence, the algorithm is as stable as point set Voronoi diagram algorithm.},

  abstract = {Presented in this paper are algorithms to compute the positions of vertices and equations of edges of the Voronoi diagram of a circle set on a plane, where the radii of the circles are not necessarily equal and the circles are not necessarily disjoint. The algorithms correctly and efficiently work in conjunction with the first paper of the series dealing with the construction of the correct topology of the Voronoi diagram of a circle set from the topology of the Voronoi diagram of a point set, where the points are centers of the circles. Given three circle generators, the position of the Voronoi vertex is computed by treating the plane as a complex plane, Z-plane, and transforming it into another complex plane, W-plane, via a linear fractional transformation. Then, the problem is formulated as a simple point location problem in regions defined by two lines and two circles in the W-plane. After the correct topology is constructed with the geometry of the vertices, the equations of edge are computed in a rational quadratic B??zier curve from. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = {Summary. The characteristics of surface-wave propagation in ocean basins are examined numerically for models with two types of anisotropic alignment in the upper mantle: one resulting from glide-plane slip in olivine with horizontal or vertical slip-planes, and the other from syntectonic recrystallization of olivine in a zone of horizontal shear. Glide-plane slip can cause highly anomalous inclined-Rayleigh particle-motion in the third-generalized mode (corresponding to the isotropic second-Rayleigh mode). The amplitude of this anomaly is rather insensitive to details of the structure. Syntectonic recrystallization can cause an anomalous combination of inclined-and tilted-Rayleigh motion in all modes. The variation with period of the amplitude of the anomaly in the fundamental mode can indicate the approximate depth to the anisotropic layer. In both types of alignment, the sense of tilt and the inclination varies with direction of propagation in a manner characteristic of the structural symmetry.

  abstract = {Changes in Vp/Vs (Poisson's ratio) around a fault are related to changes in the fluid transport properties of rocks, which play a significant role in seismogenic processes. Here we report a notable relationship between Vp/Vs and the permeability of porous fault-related rocks (Chelungpu fault, Taiwan) by direct and simultaneous measurement of elastic wave velocities (Vp and Vs) and permeability under increasing effective confining pressure (Peff) up to 25 MPa. Vp and Vs for all samples increased with Peff in the range up to 20 MPa, then were nearly constant as Peff increased to 25 MPa. Most silty sandstones with large proportions of fine-grained material showed positive correlations between Vp/Vs and permeability with rising pressure. On the other hand, well-sorted sandstones showed only slight changes in permeability with respect to Vp/Vs with rising pressure. We infer that grain size distributions, in particular the amount of silt- and clay-size grains, are responsible for the change in permeability with pressure as small particles clog pore networks with increasing Peff, causing the decrease in permeability. These findings may be useful to explain changes in permeability and pore pressure in the deep crust. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2010 RAS.},

A one-way sensitivity analysis establishes, for each of the probability parameters of a network, a function expressing a posterior marginal probability of interest in terms of the parameter. Current methods for computing the coefficients in such a function rely on a large number of network evaluations. In this paper, we present a method that requires just a single outward propagation in a junction tree for establishing the coefficients in the functions for all possible parameters; in addition, an inward propagation is required for processing evidence. Conversely, the method requires a single outward propagation for computing the coefficients in the functions expressing all possible posterior marginals in terms of a single parameter. We extend these results to an n-way sensitivity analysis in which sets of parameters are studied.},

  abstract = {Modern acquisition of seismic data on receiver networks worldwide produces an increasing amount of continuous wavefield recordings. In addition to manual data inspection, seismogram interpretation requires therefore new processing utilities for event detection, signal classification and data visualization. The use of machine learning techniques automatises decision processes and reveals the statistical properties of data. This approach is becoming more and more important and valuable for large and complex seismic records. Unsupervised learning allows the recognition of wavefield patterns, such as short-term transients and long-term variations, with a minimum of domain knowledge. This study applies an unsupervised pattern recognition approach for the discovery, imaging and interpretation of temporal patterns in seismic array recordings. For this purpose, the data is parameterized by feature vectors, which combine different real-valued wavefield attributes for short time windows. Standard seismic analysis tools are used as feature generation methods, such as frequency-wavenumber, polarization and spectral analysis. We use Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for a data-driven feature selection, visualization and clustering procedure. The application to continuous recordings of seismic signals from an active volcano (Mount Merapi, Java, Indonesia) shows that volcano-tectonic and rockfall events can be detected and distinguished by clustering the feature vectors. Similar results are obtained in terms of correctly classifying events compared to a previously implemented supervised classification system. Furthermore, patterns in the background wavefield, that is the 24-hr cycle due to human activity, are intuitively visualized by means of the SOM representation. Finally, we apply our technique to an ambient seismic vibration record, which has been acquired for local site characterization. Disturbing wavefield patterns are identified which affect the quality of Love wave dispersion curve estimates. Particularly at night, when the overall energy of the wavefield is reduced due to the 24-hr cycle, the common assumption of stationary planar surface waves can be violated. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2010 RAS.},

  abstract = {We process seismic broad-band data from southern Norway by cross correlation of ambient seismic noise in view of getting a better image of the crustal structure in the area. The main data set sterns from the temporary MAGNUS network which operated continuously from 2006 September to 2008 June. Additionally, data from permanent stations of the National Norwegian Seismic Network, the NORSAR array and GSN stations in the region are used. We compute vertical component cross-correlation functions using 41 receivers for 3-month time windows. Evaluation of the azimuthal and temporal variation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and f-k analysis of data from NORSAR array between 3 and 25 s period shows that the dominant source areas of seismic noise are located to the west and north of the network during most of the measurement time, which corresponds well to the Norwegian coast line. During summer months, the SNRs decrease but the azimuthal distribution becomes more uniform between 7 and 12 s period, suggesting a more diffuse character of the wavefield. Primary ocean microseisms above 12 s show different dominant source azimuths during this time period compared to the winter months. Time-frequency analysis is applied to measure Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves between each station pair for each 3-month correlation stack and the mean and variance of all dispersion curves is computed for each path. After rejection of low-quality data, a careful analysis shows that the group velocities are not biased by noise directionality. We invert the data for group velocity maps at period bands between 3 and 25 s. At short periods, we find an average Rayleigh wave group speed of about 3km s-1 and velocity anomalies that correlate very well with local surface geology. While higher velocities (+5 per cent) can be associated with the Caledonian nappes in the central part of southern Norway, the Oslo Graben is reflected by negative velocity anomalies (-3 to -5 per cent). At longer periods, group velocities correlate well with the variation of Moho depths beneath southern Norway. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2010 RAS.},

The present study demonstrates that, through practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program, the sympathetic nervous system and immune system can indeed be voluntarily influenced. Healthy volunteers practicing the learned techniques exhibited profound increases in the release of epinephrine, which in turn led to increased production of anti-inflammatory mediators and subsequent dampening of the proinflammatory cytokine response elicited by intravenous administration of bacterial endotoxin. This study could have important implications for the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases in which therapies that antagonize proinflammatory cytokines have shown great benefit.           ,                             Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (               n               = 12) or control group (               n               = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg               Escherichia coli               endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) is a simple, sen- sitive and robust method to measure trace gas concentrations by analyz- ing the spectrum of light that has passed through the atmosphere. Due to these advantages, DOAS gains more and more popularity for environmental monitoring in both cities and on a global scale. To use DOAS, an efficient software basis is necessary. The existing DOAS tools either concentrate only on a certain part of the whole DOAS analysis process or lack support of new devices or evaluation methods. This work will show a way to unify the already well known measurement and evaluation methods. The DOASIS Framework (DOAS Intelligent Sys- tem) covers the whole range from hardware support, data management to the evaluation process. This framework offers an easy to extend basis to cover the DOAS evaluation process as a whole including automation sup- port through a standardized scripting language. One of the major aspects in a DOAS analysis is the evaluation of the mea- sured data. Especially in scientific environments it is necessary to have an easy, fast and reliable way to test and integrate new evaluation methods. A framework will be presented that supports these needs for the non-linear evaluation process of a DOAS analysis while still providing the performance and stability of already existing software tools. Besides the improvements in the evaluation process from a technical point of view, a new method for evaluating spectral data is proposed. Using the Laplace pyramid an optimal bandwidth filter is determined for NO2 evaluation. Instead of using a polynomial to remove certain broadband structures in a spectrum and preprocessing the spectra with high- and low- pass filters, which both require user estimated parameters, the bandpass filter eliminates these.

Any new data science or machine learning project presents the decision to build, buy or outsource a solution. This note presents a series of key questions and selection criteria to guide data and analytics leaders toward the best approach as they pursue new analytics and BI strategies. Key Findings \ding{110} When getting started with machine learning and data science, many data and analytics leaders are overwhelmed by the sheer number of available solutions, and struggle to understand the differences between them. \ding{110} Data and analytics leaders are often unaware that benefits and challenges can vary significantly between the buy, build and outsource solution paths. Every project is different, and many organizations have a hybrid portfolio of built, bought and outsourced solutions. \ding{110} Choosing the wrong approach (or mix of approaches) can result in lost opportunities, wasted money, missed deadlines, suboptimal solutions and even catastrophic project failure. Recommendations For data and analytics leaders responsible for data science projects as part of analytics and BI solutions: \ding{110} Pursue the "buy" option when available packaged applications or commoditized machine learning APIs are well-suited to your use case(s), and when cost, accessibility and time to solution are more important than differentiation or extensive customization. Always explore buy options first. \ding{110} Pursue the "build" option if the proposed project would be a critical differentiator for your business, you already have strong or budding data science skills in-house, and/or you require a high level of agility and granularity of control. \ding{110} Pursue the "outsource" option if you lack the in-house talent to build your own solution and pretrained models and packaged applications don't meet your needs, or require prohibitive This research note is restricted to the personal use of tiryald@migros.com.tr. This research note is restricted to the personal use of tiryald@migros.com.tr. customization to do so. Also consider the outsource option to temporarily augment data science staff and get new projects off the ground. \ding{110} Plan to support a combination of all three options in the long term. The optimal mix will be determined by the relative effectiveness of buy options, the feasibility of build options, and the expense and sustainability of outsource options. Strategic Planning Assumptions By 2020, 85\% of CIOs will be piloting AI programs through a combination of buy, build and outsource efforts. By 2022, enterprise AI projects with built-in transparency will be 100\% more likely to get funding from CIOs.}

  abstract = {One of the most critical problems affecting geophysical data acquisition procedures is related to the misorientation of multicomponent sensors with respect to a common reference system (e.g., geographic north). In many applications, misoriented sensors affect data analysis procedures, leading to errors in results and interpretations. These problems generally occur in applications where the orientation of the sensor cannot be actively controlled and is not known a priori, e.g., geophysical sensors deployed in borehole installations or on the seafloor. We have developed a quaternion-based method for the optimal reorientation of multicomponent geophysical sensors. In contrast to other approaches, we took into account the full time-series record from all sensor components. Therefore, our method could be applied to all time-series data and was not restricted to a certain type of geophysical sensor. Our method allows the robust calculation of relative reorientations between two-component or three-component sensors. By using a reference sensor in an iterative process, this result can be extended to the estimation of absolute sensor orientations. In addition to finding an optimal solution for a full 3D sensor rotation, we have established a rigorous scheme for the estimation of uncertainties of the resulting orientation parameters. We tested the feasibility and applicability of our method using synthetic data examples for a vertical seismic profile and an ocean bottom seismometer array. We noted that the quaternion-based reorientation method is superior to the standard approach of a single-parameter estimation of rotation angles.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. The Python libraries NumPy and SciPy are extremely powerful tools for numerical processing and analysis well suited to a large variety of applications. We developed ObsPy (http://obspy.org), a Python library for seismology intended to facilitate the development of seismological software packages and workflows, to utilize these abilities and provide a bridge for seismology into the larger scientific Python ecosystem. Scientists in many domains who wish to convert their existing tools and applications to take advantage of a platform like the one Python provides are confronted with several hurdles such as special file formats, unknown terminology, and no suitable replacement for a non-trivial piece of software. We present an approach to implement a domain-specific time series library on top of the scientific NumPy stack. In so doing, we show a realization of an abstract internal representation of time series data permitting I/O support for a diverse collection of file formats. Then we detail the integration and repurposing of well established legacy codes, enabling them to be used in modern workflows composed in Python. Finally we present a case study on how to integrate research code into ObsPy, opening it to the broader community. While the implementations presented in this work are specific to seismology, many of the described concepts and abstractions are directly applicable to other sciences, especially to those with an emphasis on time series analysis.},

  abstract = {Wavelet transforms originated in geophysics in the early 1980s for the analysis of seismic signals. Since then, significant mathematical advances in wavelet theory have enabled a suite of applications in diverse fields. In geophysics the power of wavelets for analysis of nonstationary processes that contain multiscale features, detection of singularities, analysis of transient phenomena, fractal and multifractal processes, and signal compression is now being exploited for the study of several processes including space-time precipitation, remotely sensed hydrologic fluxes, atmospheric turbulence, canopy cover, laud surface topography, seafloor bathymetry, and ocean wind waves. It is anticipated that in the near future, significant further advances in understanding and modeling geophysical processes will result from the use of wavelet analysis. In this paper we review the basic properties of wavelets that make them such an attractive and powerful tool for geophysical applications. We discuss continuous, discrete, orthogonal wavelets and wavelet packets and present applications to geophysical processes.},

  abstract = {Rayleigh wave data obtained from Columbia long-period seismographs installed during the International Geophysical Year (I.G.Y.) at Honolulu, Hawaii; Suva, Fiji; and Mt. Tsukuba, Japan, are analyzed to determine group and phase velocities in the Pacific for the period range 20 to 140 seconds. Group velocities are determined by usual techniques (Ewing and Press, 1952, p. 377). Phase velocities are determined by assuming the initial phase to be independent of period and choosing the initial phase so that the phase velocity curve agrees in the long period range with the phase velocity curve of the mantle Rayleigh wave given by Brune (1961). Correlations of wave trains between the stations Honolulu and Mt. Tsukuba are used to obtain phase velocity values independent of initial phase. The group velocity rises from 3.5 km/sec at a period of about 20 see to a maximum of 4.0 km/sec at a period of about 40 sec and then decreases to 3.65 km/sec at a period of about 140 sec. Phase velocity is nearly constant in the period range 30-75 sec with a value slightly greater than 4.0 km/sec. Most of the phase velocity curves indicate a maximum and a minimum at periods of approximately 30 and 50 sec respectively. At longer periods the phase velocities increase to 4.18 km/sec at a period of 120 sec. Except across the Melanesian-New Zealand region, dispersion curves for paths of Rayleigh waves throughout the Pacific basin proper are rather uniform and agree fairly well with theoretical dispersion curves for models with a normal oceanic crust and a low velocity channel. Both phase and group velocities are comparatively lower for the paths of Rayleigh waves across the Melanesian-New Zealand region, suggesting a thicker crustal layer and/or lower crustal velocities in this region.}

Aimed at graduate students in physics, astronomy and biology and their lecturers, the text begins with a general introduction to astrobiology, followed by sections on basic prebiotic chemistry, extremophiles, and habitability in our solar system and beyond. A discussion of astrodynamics leads to a look at experimental facilities and instrumentation for space experiments and, ultimately, astrobiology missions, backed in each case by the latest research results from this fascinating field. Includes a CD-ROM with additional course material. Review "The book is an ultimate source of the modern astrobiological knowledge. It provides a justified Universal-scale framework for the understanding of the biological evolution. and last, but not least, this is am enriching and pleasant read." (Zentralblatt fur Geologie und Palaontologie, 2008) "I would recommend this book highly for dipping into and for a group library. Some of the more unusual material would be hard to scrape together from other sources and is particularly useful to have in one place. At around fifty pounds, it is a good purchase for a new astrobiologist or student expecting to study astrobiology in depth."

  abstract = {AbstractThe Alpine Fault zone in New Zealand marks a major transpressional plate boundary that is late in its typical earthquake cycle. Understanding the subsurface structures is crucial to understand the tectonic processes taking place. A unique seismic survey including 2D lines, a 3D array, and borehole recordings, has been performed in the Whataroa Valley and provides new insights into the Alpine Fault zone down to {$\sim$}2 km depth at the location of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP)-2 drill site. Seismic images are obtained by focusing prestack depth migration approaches. Despite the challenging conditions for seismic imaging within a sediment filled glacial valley and steeply dipping valley flanks, several structures related to the valley itself as well as the tectonic fault system are imaged. A set of several reflectors dipping 40\textendash 56\textdegree{} to the southeast are identified in a {$\sim$}600 m wide zone that is interpreted to be the minimum extent of the damage zone. Different approaches image one distinct reflector dipping at {$\sim$}40\textdegree, which is interpreted to be the main Alpine Fault reflector located only {$\sim$}100 m beneath the maximum drilled depth of the DFDP-2B borehole. At shallower depths (z{$<$}0.5 km), additional reflectors are identified as fault segments with generally steeper dips up to 56\textdegree. Additionally, a glacially over-deepened trough with nearly horizontally layered sediments and a major fault (z{$<$}0.5 km) are identified 0.5\textendash 1 km south of the DFDP-2B borehole. Thus, a complex structural environment is seismically imaged and shows the complexity of the Alpine Fault at Whataroa.},

These volcanoes rest on Mesozoic metasedimentary basement with local intervening Miocene sediments. Both volcanoes have complex growth histories, closely linked to the presence or absence of glacial ice that controlled the distribution and preservation of lavas. Ruapehu cone-building vents are focused into a short NNE-separated pair, whereas Tongariro vents are more widely distributed along that trend, the differences reflecting local rifting rates and faulting intensities. Both volcanoes have erupted basaltic andesite to dacite (53\textendash 66 wt.\% silica), but mostly plagioclase-two pyroxene andesites from storage zones at 5\textendash 10 km depth. Erupted compositions contain evidence for magma mixing and interaction with basement rocks. Each volcano has an independent magmatic system and a growth history related to long-term ({$>$}104 years) cycles of mantle-derived magma supply, unrelated to glacial/interglacial cycles. Historic eruptions at both volcanoes are compositionally diverse, reflecting small, dispersed magma sources. Both volcanoes often show signs of volcanic unrest and have erupted with a wide range of styles and associated hazards, most recently in 2007 (Ruapehu) and 2012 (Tongariro).},

While the origin of associated Rayleigh waves is well understood, there is currently no quantified explanation for the existence of Love waves in the most energetic region of the microseism spectrum (3\textendash 10\,s). Here, using terrestrial seismic arrays and 3D synthetic acoustic-elastic simulations combined with ocean wave hindcast data, we demonstrate that, observed from land, our general understanding of Rayleigh and Love wave microseism sources is significantly impacted by 3D propagation path effects. We show that while Rayleigh to Love wave conversions occur along the microseism path, Love waves predominantly originate from steep subsurface geological interfaces and bathymetry, directly below the ocean source that couples to the solid Earth. We conclude that, in contrast to Rayleigh waves, microseism Love waves observed on land do not directly relate to the ocean wave climate but are significantly modulated by continental margin morphologies, with a first order effect from sedimentary basins. Hence, they yield rich spatio-temporal information about ocean-land coupling in deep water.},

  abstract = {The recent installation of six broadband digital IRIS/IDA seismic stations in the USSR has provided new opportunities for studying surface-wave propagation across Eurasia. Group velocities of fundamental Rayleigh and Love modes between epicenters and these stations were determined for 35 events. Differential phase velocities were found for the same arrivals along paths between several pairs of stations. Frequency-time polarization analysis was used for studying polarization properties of surface waves. In some cases, significant anomalies in the particle motion for periods up to 100 sec were observed. They are attributed to surface-wave refraction and scattering due to lateral inhomogeneities at the boundaries and inside the Eurasia continent. -Authors}

This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years, and it was intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure is divided into four principal phases; (1) single station data preparation; (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking; (3) measurements of dispersion curves (performed with frequency-time analysis for both group and phase speeds); (4) quality control, including SNR analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. In addition, we gave a specific solution for how to use these seismic station data better in ambient noise study.},

We apply the GAN critic as an automatic feature extractor and train a Random Forest classifier with about 700,000 earthquake and noise waveforms. We show that the discriminator can recognize 99.2\% of the earthquake P waves and 98.4\% of the noise signals. This state-of-the-art performance is expected to reduce significantly the number of false triggers from local impulsive noise.

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

  abstract = {The concept of a relaxation spectrum is used to compute the absorption and dispersion of a linear anelastic solid. The Boltzmann after-effect equation is solved for a solid having a linear relationship between stress and strain and their first time derivatives, the 'standard linear solid', and having a distribution of relaxation times. The distribution function is chosen to give a nearly constant Q over the seismic frequency range. Both discrete and continuous relaxation spectra are considered. The resulting linear solid has a broad absorption band which can be interpreted in terms of a super-position of absorption peaks of individual relaxation mechanisms. The accompanying phase and group velocity dispersion imply that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or laboratory and seismic data without correcting for absorption. The neces-sary formalism for making these corrections is given. In the constant Q regions the correction is the same as that implied in the theories of Futter-man, Lomnitz, Strick and Kolsky. 1 Introduction It is usually assumed in seismological studies that elastic moduli and seismic wave velocities are independent of frequency. This is equivalent to assuming that the Earth is perfectly elastic or that seismic frequencies are far away from any absorption bands. However, the fact that seismic waves attenuate with distance and that free oscillations decay with time indicate that the Earth is not an ideal elastic body. The observation that Q-', the specific dissipation function or seismic quality factor, is roughly constant from the body wave to the free oscil-lation band indiates that Q-' cannot satisfy the w or w-'-dependence required by physical mechanisms of attenuation at frequencies remote from the characteristic frequency of the attenuation mechanism. For example, the observation that ScS waves of periods of 10-30 s have approximately the same Q as toroidal oscillations of periods in excess of 1000 s (e.g. provides a strong constraint on the dissipation spectrum and the associated dispersion, even if Q is not precisely independent of frequency. The consequences of dispersions are that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or compare laboratory ultrasonic and shock wave data with seismic data, unless corrections are made for phase velocity dispersion arising from anelasticity. The importance of phase velocity disper-sion due to anelasticity has been discussed by Lomnitz (1957), Jeffreys (1965), Carpenter \& Davies (1966), Futterman (1962), Strick (1967), Lamb (1962) and Randall (1976). Although body wave data are often corrected for dispersion (e.g. Carpenter 1967; Helm-berger 1973) using Futterman's theory (Futterman 1962), the effect of physical dispersion is usually ignored in surface wave and free oscillation interpretations. The reason, possibly, is that there are arbitrary assumptions and physical shortcomings in most of the theories that have been put forward to explain the near constancy of Q and the resulting required phase velocity dispersion. In this paper we show from general physical considerations, that the phase velocity dispersion due to anelasticity is important. This affects inversion of surface wave and free oscillation data, inferences from body wave spectra, comparison of body wave and normal mode earth models, discussions of the base line problems in travel times and oceanic-continental differences and use of laboratory high pressure, high tem-perature data to infer the composition of the Earth.},

Under this framework, several currently available techniques are studied and generalized to accommodate more complex features. All of these methods are partial combinations of three ingredients: importance sampling and resampling, rejection sampling, and Markov chain iterations. We provide guidelines on how they should be used and under what circumstance each method is most suitable. Through the analysis of differences and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm by combining desirable features. In addition, we propose a general use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performance. Examples from econometrics and engineering are presented to demonstrate the importance of Rao\textendash Blackwellization and to compare different Monte Carlo procedures. \textcopyright{} 1998 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Here we focus on the conditions and processes in the Oruanui magma that erupted at 26.5 ka from Taupo Volcano, New Zealand. The 530 km(3) (void-free) of material erupted in the Oruanui event is comparable in size to the Bishop Tuff in California, but differs in that rhyolitic pumice and glass compositions, although variable, did not change systematically with eruption order. We measured the concentrations of H2O, CO2 and major and trace elements in zoned phenocrysts and melt inclusions from individual pumice clasts covering the range from early to late erupted units. We also used cathodoluminescence imaging to infer growth histories of quartz phenocrysts. For quartz-hosted inclusions, we studied both fully enclosed melt inclusions and reentrants (connecting to host melt through a small opening). The textures and compositions of inclusions and phenocrysts reflect complex pre-eruptive processes of incomplete assimilation/partial melting, crystallization differentiation, magma mixing and gas saturation. 'Restitic' quartz occurs in seven of eight pumice clasts studied. Variations in dissolved H2O and CO2 in quartz-hosted melt inclusions reflect gas saturation in the Oruanui magma and crystallization depths of similar to 3.5-7 km. Based on variations of dissolved H2O and CO2 in reentrants, the amount of exsolved gas at the beginning of eruption increased with depth, corresponding to decreasing density with depth. Pre-eruptive mixing of magma with varying gas content implies variations in magma bulk density that would have driven convective mixing.},

Second, we use our causal direction classifier to effectively distinguish between features of objects and features of their contexts in collections of static images. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of a relation between the direction of causality and the difference between objects and their contexts, and by the same token, the existence of observable signals that reveal the causal dispositions of objects.},

  abstract = {Scanning spectrometer networks using scattered solar radiation in the ultraviolet spectral region have become an increasingly important tool for monitoring volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Often measured spectra are evaluated using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. In order to obtain absolute column densities (CDs), the DOAS evaluation requires a Fraunhofer reference spectrum (FRS) that is free of absorption structures of the trace gas of interest. For measurements at volcanoes such a FRS can be readily obtained if the scan (i.e. series of measurements at different elevation angles) includes viewing directions where the plume is not seen. In this case, it is possible to use these viewing directions (e.g. zenith) as FRS. Possible contaminations of the FRS by the plume can then be corrected by calculating and subtracting an SO2 offset (e.g. the lowest SO2 CD) from all viewing directions of the respective scan. This procedure is followed in the standard evaluations of data from the Network for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric Change (NOVAC). While this procedure is very efficient in removing Fraunhofer structures and instrumental effects it has the disadvantage that one can never be sure that there is no SO2 from the plume in the FRS. Therefore, using a modelled FRS (based on a high-resolution solar atlas) has a great advantage. We followed this approach and investigated an SO2 retrieval algorithm using a modelled FRS. In this paper, we present results from two volcanoes that are monitored by NOVAC stations and which frequently emit large volcanic plumes: Nevado del Ruiz (Colombia) recorded between January 2010 and June 2012 and from Tungurahua (Ecuador) recorded between January 2009 and December 2011. Instrumental effects were identified with help of a principal component analysis (PCA) of the residual structures of the DOAS evaluation. The SO2 retrieval performed extraordinarily well with an SO2 DOAS retrieval error of 1 -2 \texttimes{} 1016[molecules cm-2]. Compared to a standard evaluation, we found systematic differences of the differential slant column density (dSCD) of only up to {$\approx$} 15\% when looking at the variation of the SO2 within one scan. The major advantage of our new retrieval is that it yields absolute SO2 CDs and that it does not require complicated instrumental calibration in the field (e.g. by employing calibration cells or broadband light sources), since the method exploits the information available in the measurements. We compared our method to an evaluation that is similar to the NOVAC approach, where a spectrum that is recorded directly before the scan is used as an FRS and an SO2 CD offset is subtracted from all retrieved dSCD in the scan to correct for possible SO2 contamination of the FRS. The investigation showed that 21.4\% of the scans (containing significant amounts of SO2) at Nevado del Ruiz and 7\% of the scans at Tungurahua showed much larger SO2 CDs when evaluated using modelled FRS (more than a factor of 2). For standard evaluations the overall distribution of the SO2 CDs in a scan can in some cases indicate whether the plume affects all viewing directions and thus these scans need to be discarded for NOVAC emission rate evaluation. However, there are other cases where this is not possible and thus the reported SO2 emission rates would be underestimated. The new method can be used to identify these cases and thus it can considerably improve SO2 emission budgets.}

  abstract = {The 6 August 2012 Te Maari eruption produced violent and widespread "cold" Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) following unroofing of the pressurized hydrothermal system. Despite an erupted volume of only \textasciitilde 5\texttimes 105m3, and lacking any juvenile component, the 340,000m3 of PDCs spread over an area of 6.1km2 and had mobilities that were on the order of volcanic blasts or blast-like PDCs. This great mobility was due to strong lateral focussing of explosion energy, producing jets with initial velocities {$>$}100m/s. We present a type-stratigraphy for these hydrothermal-derived low-temperature PDCs that show a tripartite deposit sequence. Each of the deposit units dominates respectively three outward-gradational sedimentary facies, reflecting transitions in the propagating PDC transport and depositional mechanisms. The largest PDCs, directed west and east of the Upper Te Maari area were generated from outer-cone breccias and tuffs that were mostly highly hydrothermally altered. Landsliding and the geometry of the hydrothermal area led to the directed jetting. Initial particle-laden jets laid sheets, grading into lobes of proximal massive sand to gravel-rich facies dominated by unit A and extending up to 1km from the vents. As the jets were collapsing, a vertically and longitudinally stratified PDC developed within the first few hundred metres from source. Exponential thinning and coarse-tail grading-dominated fining with radial distance of massive unit A resulted from fast deposition and progressive depletion of the most concentrated flow region behind the PDC head. Markedly slower tractional sedimentation from the passing PDC body and tail deposited the highly stratified and ripple-bedded fine-coarse ash of unit B. This formed distinctive dune fields of the medial dune-bedded ash-rich facies. Upwards in depositional sequences the waning of the current can be seen, by replacement of higher-energy bedforms to progressively lower ones. Downstream progressive waning and further depletion are characterised by the development of the distal wavy to planar-bedded ash-rich facies. This is increasingly dominated by the uppermost deposition unit C of laminated fine-med ash deposited by gently turbulent, dilute phoenix clouds. These high energy PDCs, sourced from flank hydrothermal systems should be regarded as a serious threat in any multihazard assessment of a stratovolcano, even though they may not be one of the major magmatic vent sites. In addition, further detailed studies of these hydrothermal jetting events and their deposits should be pursued in order to better understand large-volume volcanic blasts, which appear to be a larger scale sibling phenomenon.},

Recently, the dramatic increase in the volume of various types of Earth observation `big data' from multiple sources, and the rapid development of deep learning as a state-of-the-art data analysis tool, have enabled novel advances in geological hazard analysis, with the ultimate aim to mitigate the devastation associated with these hazards. Motivated by numerous applications, this paper presents an overview of the advances in the utilization of deep learning for geological hazard analysis. First, six commonly available Earth observation data sources are described, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite platforms, and in-situ monitoring systems. Second, the deep learning background and six typical deep learning models are introduced, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Third, focusing on six typical geological hazards, i.e., landslides, debris flows, rockfalls, avalanches, earthquakes, and volcanoes, the deep learning applications for geological hazard analysis are reviewed, and common application paradigms are summarized. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for the application of deep learning models for geological hazard analysis are highlighted, with the aim to inspire further related research.},

  abstract = {The Auckland Region, New Zealand is at significant risk from tephra falls originating both from the local Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF) and several distant, large-volume centres. We use geological data and observations of historical eruptions to develop a catalogue of simulated tephra dispersal patterns for the Auckland Region, using the ASHFALL model. Simulated patterns relate to individual eruptive phases and can be combined to simulate events that vary in volume and duration. AVF eruption parameters were chosen to replicate fine tephra fall dispersed from small-volume phreatomagmatic eruptions. Modelling of eruptions from distant volcanoes was carried out in two stages. First, the sensitivity of modelled tephra thickness to various model parameters was tested. By far the largest thickness variations were the result of varying wind conditions, followed by eruption volume. The second stage involved modelling volumes that best replicated thicknesses of preserved events within the Auckland Region, allowing the catalogue to be created. Only about 1\% of simulations from distant volcanoes reached the Auckland Region, suggesting that preserved tephra layers are either the result of reasonably long-lived eruptions or a number of eruptive phases. For eruptions originating within the AVF, mean modelled tephra thickness on land is small\textemdash approximately 1.6 mm near the coast and thinning rapidly inland. Mean andesitic thicknesses are dominated by eruptions from Egmont volcano, which typically deposit tephra over a narrow section of the Auckland Region with a maximum thickness of approximately 1.7 mm. Rhyolitic eruptions are more widespread, with mean thickness varying from 30 mm in the south of the Region to 9 mm in the north. When all centres are combined and weighted by their conditional likelihood of occurrence, mean thickness ranges from 7 mm in the south to 1.5 mm in the north. However, maximum thicknesses of 150 mm for the AVF, 12 mm for andesitic centres and 830 mm for rhyolitic centres all have the potential to cause much greater damage within parts of the Auckland Region.},

With the increasing volume and scale of available ML techniques in seismology, annotating seismograms or seismic features has become time consuming and tedious for many researchers. Furthermore, most methods train and validate on unique data subsets, which hampers independent performance evaluation and comparison. To address this problem, we have developed the software QuakeLabeler, an open-source Python package to customize, build, and manage earthquake training data sets, including processing and visualization. QuakeLabeler has tight pipeline functions, which include retrieving seismograms from multiple online data centers, querying online human-reviewed catalogs, signal processing, annotating (labeling), and analyzing data distribution. In addition, relevant statistical graphics and human-readable output files can be generated. Various file export formats are supported, such as Seismic Analysis Code (*.sac), mini Standard for Exchange of Earthquake Data (*.mseed), NumPy (*.npz), MATLAB (*.mat), and the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (*.hdf5). This toolbox is packaged with an interactive command-line interface. Three alternative running modes (beginner, advanced, and benchmark) are implemented, intended to offer specific data set solutions for different types of applications, that is, quick-start recipes for simple ML solutions, advanced design for customized project training, and benchmark bulletins for model comparison.},

  abstract = {The prediction of volcanic eruptions and the evaluation of associated risks remain a timely and unresolved issue. This paper presents a method to automatically classify seismic events linked to volcanic activity. As increased seismic activity is an indicator of volcanic unrest, automatic classification of volcano seismic events is of major interest for volcano monitoring. The proposed architecture is based on supervised classification, whereby a prediction model is built from an extensive data set of labeled observations. Relevant events should then be detected. Three steps are involved in the building of the prediction model: (i) signals preprocessing, (ii) representation of the signals in the feature space, and (iii) use of an automatic classifier to train the model. Our main contribution lies in the feature space where the seismic observations are represented by 102 features gathered from both acoustic and seismic fields. Ideally, observations are separable in the feature space, depending on their class. The architecture is tested on 109,609 seismic events that were recorded between June 2006 and September 2011 at Ubinas Volcano, Peru. Six main classes of signals are considered: long-period events, volcanic tremors, volcano tectonic events, explosions, hybrid events, and tornillos. Our model reaches 93.5\% {$\pm$} 0.50\% accuracy, thereby validating the presented architecture and the features used. Furthermore, we illustrate the limited influence of the learning algorithm used (i.e., random forest and support vector machines) by showing that the results remain accurate regardless of the algorithm selected for the training stage. The model is then used to analyze 6 years of data.},

  abstract = {Passive seismic surveying methods represent a valuable tool in local seismic hazard assessment, oil and gas prospection, and in geotechnical investigations. Array processing techniques are used in order to estimate wavefield properties such as dispersion curves of surface waves and ellipticity of Rayleigh waves. However, techniques presently in use often fail to properly merge information from three-components sensors and do not account for the presence of multiple waves. In this paper, a technique for maximum likelihood estimation of wavefield parameters including direction of propagation, velocity of Love waves and Rayleigh waves, and ellipticity of Rayleigh waves is described. This technique models jointly all the measurements and all the wavefield parameters. Furthermore it is possible to model the simultaneous presence of multiple waves. The performance of this technique is evaluated on a high-fidelity synthetic data set and on real data. It is shown that the joint modelling of all the sensor components, decreases the variance of wavenumber estimates and allows the retrieval of the ellipticity value together with an estimate of the prograde/retrograde motion.},

  abstract = {Non-linear teleseismic bodywave tomography with data of the 1999 CALIXTO field experiment (Carpathian Arc Lithosphere X-Tomography) in Romania provides high-resolution imaging of the upper-mantle structure. In this paper, we present the relative P-wave velocity distribution of the lithosphere/asthenosphere system. Smearing from strong crustal velocity anomalies into the upper mantle is successfully suppressed by traveltime corrections with an a priori 3-D regional crustal velocity model (see Martin et al. 2005, herein referenced as paper 1). Our high-resolution image shows a high-velocity body beneath Vrancea and the Moesian platformwith a NE-SW orientation between 70 and 200 km depth. Beneath 200 km a change in the orientation from NE-SW to N-S can be observed. The body reaches a maximum depth of about 350-370 km. The velocity perturbation is maximal between 110 and 150 km depth (5.2-5.8 per cent) and almost constant for depths beneath 200 km (3.2-3.8 per cent). As most authors of previous studies agree on Miocene subduction along the arc followed by soft continental collision we interpret the high-velocity body as the subducted, yet not fully detached slab. The NE-part of the slab appears to be mechanically coupled to the Moesian lithosphere and hosts the intermediate depth seismicity. In contrast the aseismic SW-part is interpreted as decoupled from the overlying lithosphere and torn off from the underlying lithospheric material beneath 200 km depth. Low velocity anomalies NW of the slab above 110 km depth are interpreted as a shallow asthenospheric upwelling. Further low-velocity anomalies are in agreement with a lithosphereasthenosphere boundary at 110-150 km depth below the Moesian platform and deeper than 200 km under the East European platform (EEP). The tomographic images support models proposing slab rollback during subduction/collision, followed by slab steepening and lithospheric delamination. The different degrees of mechanical coupling of the slab to the overlying lithosphere allow to understand the loci of seismicity as volumes of stress concentration. Independent on the specifics of data interpretation our high-resolution image is a novel contribution to understand the process of ongoing lithospheric detachment associated with strong intermediate-depth seismicity in SE-Romania. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2006 RAS.},

The procedure is based on a Bayesian approach that produces a probability estimation of any possible event in which we are interested and can make use of all available information including theoretical models, historical and geological data, and monitoring observations. The main steps in the procedure are (1) to estimate an a priori probability distribution based upon theoretical knowledge, (2) to modify that using past data, and (3) to modify it further using current monitoring data. The scheme allows epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties to be dealt with in a formal way, through estimation of probability distributions at each node of the event tree. We then describe an application of the method to the case of Mount Vesuvius. Although the primary intent of the example is to illustrate the methodology, one result of this application merits special mention. The present emergency response plan for Mount Vesuvius is referenced to a maximum expected event (MEE), the largest out of all the possible eruptions within the next few decades. Our calculation suggest that there is a nonnegligible (1\textendash 20\%) chance that the next eruption could be larger than that stipulated in the present MEE. The methodology allows all assumptions and thresholds to be clearly identified and provides a rational means for their revision if new data or information are obtained.},

The results indicate different behavior for volcanoes with "open" conduit regimes compared to those with "closed" conduit regimes. Open conduit systems follow a time predictable model, with a marked time clustering of events; closed conduit systems have no significant tendency toward a size or a time predictable model, and the eruptions follow mostly a Poisson distribution.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The main purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of clarifying the probabilistic framework adopted for volcanic hazard and eruption forecasting. Eruption forecasting and volcanic hazard analysis seeks to quantify the deep uncertainties that pervade the modeling of pre-, sin- and post-eruptive processes. These uncertainties can be differentiated into three fundamental types: (1) the natural variability of volcanic systems, usually represented as stochastic processes with parameterized distributions ({$<$}em{$>$}aleatory variability{$<$}/em{$>$}); (2) the uncertainty in our knowledge of how volcanic systems operate and evolve, often represented as subjective probabilities based on expert opinion ({$<$}em{$>$}epistemic uncertainty{$<$}/em{$>$}); and (3) the possibility that our forecasts are wrong owing to behaviors of volcanic processes about which we are completely ignorant and, hence, cannot quantify in terms of probabilities ({$<$}em{$>$}ontological error{$<$}/em{$>$}). Here we put forward a probabilistic framework for hazard analysis recently proposed by Marzocchi \&amp; Jordan (2014), which unifies the treatment of all three types of uncertainty. Within this framework, an eruption forecasting or a volcanic hazard model is said to be complete only if it (a) fully characterizes the epistemic uncertainties in the model's representation of aleatory variability and (b) can be unconditionally tested (in principle) against observations to identify ontological errors. Unconditional testability, which is the key to model validation, hinges on an {$<$}em{$>$}experimental concept{$<$}/em{$>$} that characterizes hazard events in terms of exchangeable data sequences with well-defined frequencies. We illustrate the application of this unified probabilistic framework by describing experimental concepts for the forecasting of tephra fall from Campi Flegrei. Eventually, this example may serve as a guide for the application of the same probabilistic framework to other natural hazards.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {During volcanic eruptions, volcanic ash transport and dispersion models (VATDs) are used to forecast the location and movement of ash clouds over hours to days in order to define hazards to aircraft and to communities downwind. Those models use input parameters, called ``eruption source parameters'', such as plume height H, mass eruption rate \.M, duration D, and the mass fraction m63 of erupted debris finer than about 4{$\phi$} or 63~{$\mu$}m, which can remain in the cloud for many hours or days. Observational constraints on the value of such parameters are frequently unavailable in the first minutes or hours after an eruption is detected. Moreover, observed plume height may change during an eruption, requiring rapid assignment of new parameters. This paper reports on a group effort to improve the accuracy of source parameters used by VATDs in the early hours of an eruption. We do so by first compiling a list of eruptions for which these parameters are well constrained, and then using these data to review and update previously studied parameter relationships. We find that the existing scatter in plots of H versus \.M yields an uncertainty within the 50\% confidence interval of plus or minus a factor of four in eruption rate for a given plume height. This scatter is not clearly attributable to biases in measurement techniques or to well-recognized processes such as elutriation from pyroclastic flows. Sparse data on total grain-size distribution suggest that the mass fraction of fine debris m63 could vary by nearly two orders of magnitude between small basaltic eruptions ({$\sim$}0.01) and large silicic ones ({$>$}0.5). We classify eleven eruption types; four types each for different sizes of silicic and mafic eruptions; submarine eruptions; ``brief'' or Vulcanian eruptions; and eruptions that generate co-ignimbrite or co-pyroclastic flow plumes. For each eruption type we assign source parameters. We then assign a characteristic eruption type to each of the world's {$\sim$}1500 Holocene volcanoes. These eruption types and associated parameters can be used for ash-cloud modeling in the event of an eruption, when no observational constraints on these parameters are available.},

We combine infrasound signal association across multiple stations with source location using a brute-force, grid-search, cross-bearings approach. The algorithm corrects for a background prior rate of coherent unwanted infrasound signals (clutter) in a global grid, without needing to screen array processing detection lists from individual stations prior to association. We develop the algorithm using case studies of explosive eruptions: 2008 Kasatochi, Alaska; 2009 Sarychev Peak, Kurile Islands; and 2010 Eyjafjallaj\"okull, Iceland. We apply the method to global IMS infrasound data from 2005\textendash 2010 to construct a preliminary acoustic catalog that emphasizes sustained explosive volcanic activity (long-duration signals or sequences of impulsive transients lasting hours to days). This work represents a step toward the goal of integrating IMS infrasound data products into global volcanic eruption early warning and notification systems. Additionally, a better understanding of volcanic signal detection and location with the IMS helps improve operational event detection, discrimination, and association capabilities.},

Thus, the data wave field is linearly transformed from the time-distance domain into the slowness-frequency (p-omega) domain, where dispersion curves are imaged. All the data are present throughout the transformations. Dispersion curves for the mode overtones as well as the fundamental are directly observed in the transformed wave field. In the p-omega domain, each mode is separated from the others even when its presence is not visually detectable n the unstransformed data. The resolution achieved in the result is indicated in the p-omega wave field by the width and coherence of the image. The method is applied to both synthetic and real datasets.}

Understanding the rupture behavior of megathrust events is crucial for earthquake rupture physics, as well as for earthquake early-warning systems. However, the large variability in behavior between individual events seemingly defies a description with a simple unifying model. Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone earthquakes, with moment magnitude M w {$\geq$} 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal behavior. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median behavior are multiplicative and Gaussian\textemdash that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that earthquake magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.},

  abstract = {Real-time ground motion alerts, as can be provided by Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems, need to be both timely and sufficiently accurate to be useful. Yet how timely and how accurate the alerts of existing EEW algorithms are is often poorly understood. In part, this is because EEW algorithm performance is usually evaluated not in terms of ground motion prediction accuracy and timeliness but in terms of other metrics (e.g., magnitude and location estimation errors), which do not directly reflect the usefulness of the alerts from an end user perspective. Here we attempt to identify a suite of metrics for EEW algorithm performance evaluation that directly quantify an algorithm's ability to identify target sites that will experience ground motion above a critical (user-defined) ground motion threshold. We process 15,553 recordings from 238 earthquakes with M {$>$} 5 (mostly from Japan and southern California) in a pseudo-real-time environment and investigate two end-member EEW methods. We use the metrics to highlight both the potential and limitations of the two algorithms and to show under which circumstances useful alerts can be provided. Such metrics could be used by EEW algorithm developers to convincingly demonstrate the added value of new algorithms or algorithm components. They can complement existing performance metrics that quantify other relevant aspects of EEW algorithms (e.g., false event detection rates) for a comprehensive and meaningful EEW performance analysis.},

  abstract = {This article explains the features of differential data that make them attractive, their shortcomings, and the situations for which they are best suited. The use of differential data is ubiquitous in the seismological community, in which they are used to determine earthquake locations via the double-difference method and the Earth's velocity structure via geotomography; furthermore, they have important applications in other areas of geophysics, as well. A common assumption is that differential data are uncorrelated and have uniform variance. We show that this assumption is well justified when the original, undifferenced data covary with each other according to a two-sided exponential function. It is not well justified when they covary according to a Gaussian function. Differences of exponentially correlated data are approximately uncorrelated with uniform variance when they are regularly spaced in distance. However, when they are irregularly spaced, they are uncorrelated with a nonuniform variance that scales with the spacing of the data. When differential data are computed by taking differences of the original, undifferenced data, model parameters estimated using ordinary least squares applied to the differential data are almost exactly equal to those estimated using weighed least squares applied to the original, undifferenced data (with the weights given by the inverse covariance matrix). A better solution only results when the differential data are directly estimated and their variance is smaller than is implied by differencing the original data. Differential data may be appropriate for global seismic travel-time data because the covariance of errors in predicted travel times may have a covariance close to a two-sided exponential, on account of the upper mantle being close to a Von Karman medium with exponent {$\kappa\ll$}12.},

  author = {{Van der Merwe}, Rudolph},
  year = {2004},
  number = {April},
  abstract = {Probabilistic inference is the problem of estimating the hidden variables (states or parameters) of a system in an optimal and consistent fashion as a set of noisy or incomplete observations of the system becomes available online. The optimal solution to this problem is given by the recursive Bayesian estimation algorithm which recursively updates the posterior density of the system state as new observations arrive. This posterior density constitutes the complete solution to the probabilistic inference problem, and allows us to calculate any "optimal" estimate of the state. Unfortunately, for most real-world problems, the optimal Bayesian recursion is intractable and approximate solutions must be used. Within the space of approximate solutions, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become one of the most widely used algorithms with applications in state, parameter and dual estimation. Unfortunately, the EKF is based on a sub-optimal implementation of the recursive Bayesian estimation framework applied to Gaussian random variables. This can seriously affect the accuracy or even lead to divergence of any inference system that is based on the EKF or that uses the EKF as a component part. Recently a number of related novel, more accurate and theoretically better motivated algorithmic alternatives to the EKF have surfaced in the literature, with specific application to state estimation for automatic control. We have extended these algorithms, all based on derivativeless deterministic sampling based approximations of the relevant Gaussian statistics, to a family of algorithms called Sigma-Point Kalman Filters (SPKF). Furthermore, we successfully expanded the use of this group of algorithms (SPKFs) within the general field of probabilistic inference and machine learning, both as stand-alone filters and as subcomponents of more powerful sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters). We have consistently shown that there are large performance benefits to be gained by applying Sigma-Point Kalman filters to areas where EKFs have been used as the de facto standard in the past, as well as in new areas where the use of the EKF is impossible.},

  abstract = {Various numerical methods have been proposed and used to investigate wave propagation in realistic earth media. Recently an innovative numerical method, known as the Spectral Element Method (SEM), has been developed and used in connection with wave propagation problems in 3D elastic media (Komatitsch and Tromp, 1999). The SEM combines the flexibility of a finite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method and it is not cumbersome in dealing with non-flat free surface and spatially variable anelastic attenuation. The SEM is a highly accurate numerical method that has its origins in computational fluid dynamics. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wavefield on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simplifies the algorithm. The most important property of the SEM is that the mass matrix is exactly diagonal by construction, which drastically simplifies the implementation and reduces the computational cost because one can use an explicit time integration scheme without having to invert a linear system. Furthermore, it allows an efficient parallel implementation. We sketch the formulation of the SEM in matrix form that is familiar to earthquake engineers. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the method by implementing the proposed formulation to study various simple/canonical problems.},

Ruapehu volcano, New Zealand. Hyperspectral imaging is sensitive to surface mineralogy including alteration minerals, while magnetic vector inversion reveals the volumetric distribution of magnetic susceptibility from which we interpret buried geology. Probability assessment from multiple model regularizations provides an important model uncertainty estimate. At Ruapehu, hyperspectral imaging highlights two main regions of surface alteration: the Pinnacle Ridge and the southeast flanks. The magnetic model of Pinnacle Ridge shows that alteration seen at surface continues to depth, but strongly magnetic, unaltered dikes form the core of the ridge. On the southeast flanks, the magnetic model also shows alteration imaged on the surface continues to depth; however, a previously unknown, magnetized sill intrudes part of the flank. Several smaller demagnetized regions are modeled, unlike at neighboring Mt. Tongariro where the hydrothermal system created a large demagnetized core. We propose that these differences relate to spatially focused (Ruapehu) vs distributed (Tongariro) eruption vents, the degree of faulting of the edifice and its glaciation history. Lava-ice interaction produces fine-grained lavas with measured magnetic susceptibilities similar to some moderately altered lavas, illustrating that care must be taken in the interpretation of magnetic data in the absence of geological information. The combination of hyperspectral imaging and aeromagnetic data inversion distinguishes shallow surface weathering from deeper-seated hydrothermally altered rock masses, with implications for the magnitude and probability of collapse events.},

  abstract = {Volcanic ash is an increasingly common, long-range hazard, impacting on our globalised society. The Asia-Pacific region is rapidly developing as a major contributor to the global population and economy and is home to one-quarter of the world's active volcanoes. Here we present a regional-scale volcanic ash hazard assessment for the Asia-Pacific using a newly developed framework for Probabilistic Volcanic Ash Hazard Analysis (PVAHA). This PVAHA was undertaken using the Volcanic Ash Probabilistic Assessment of Hazard (VAPAH) algorithm. The VAPAH algorithm considered a magnitude-frequency distribution of eruptions and associated volcanic ash load attenuation relationships for the Asia-Pacific, and integrated across all possible events to arrive at an annual exceedance probability for sites of interest. The Asia-Pacific region was divided into six sub-regions (e.g. Indonesia, Philippines and Southeast Asia, Melanesia/Australia, Japan/Taiwan, New Zealand/Samoa/Tonga/Fiji and Russia/China/Mongolia/Korea) characterised by 276 source volcanoes each with individual magnitude-frequency relationships. Sites for analysis within the Asia-Pacific region were limited to land-based locations at 1-km grid spacing, within 500~km of a volcanic source. The Indonesian sub-region exhibited the greatest volcanic ash hazard in the region at the 100-year timeframe, with additional sources (in Japan, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Kamchatka - Russia and New Zealand) along plate boundaries manifesting a high degree of hazard at the 10,000-year timeframe. Disaggregation of the volcanic ash hazard for individual sites of interest provided insight into the primary causal factors for volcanic ash hazard at capital cities in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Japan. This PVAHA indicated that volcanic ash hazard for Port Moresby was relatively low at all timeframes. In contrast to this, Jakarta, Manila and Tokyo are characterised by high degrees hazard at all timeframes. The greatest hazard was associated with Tokyo and the PVAHA was able to quantify that the large number of sources impacting on this location was the causal factor contributing to the hazard. This evidence-based approach provides important insights for decision makers responsible for strategic planning and can assist with prioritising regions of interest for more detailed volcanic ash hazard modelling and local scale planning.},

  abstract = {The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2013.

We use simple seismological relationships to calculate the minimum time that must elapse before such ground motion can be expected at a distance from the earthquake, assuming that the earthquake magnitude is not predictable. Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems are in operation or development for many regions around the world, with the goal of providing enough warning of incoming ground shaking to allow people and automated systems to take protective actions to mitigate losses. However, the question of how much warning time is physically possible for specified levels of ground motion has not been addressed. We con-sider a zero-latency EEW system to determine possible warning times a user could receive in an ideal case. In this case, the only limitation on warning time is the time required for the earthquake to evolve and the time for strong ground motion to arrive at a user's location. We find that users who wish to be alerted at lower ground motion thresholds will receive more robust warnings with longer average warning times than users who receive warnings for higher ground motion thresholds. EEW systems have the greatest potential benefit for users willing to take action at relatively low ground motion thresholds, whereas users who set relatively high thresholds for taking action are less likely to receive timely and actionable information.},

  abstract = {Particle filters (PFs) have become popular for assimilation of a wide range of hydrologic variables in recent years. With this increased use, it has become necessary to increase the applicability of this technique for use in complex hydrologic/land surface models and to make these methods more viable for operational probabilistic prediction. To make the PF a more suitable option in these scenarios, it is necessary to improve the reliability of these techniques. Improved reliability in the PF is achieved in this work through an improved parameter search, with the use of variable variance multipliers and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Application of these methods to the PF allows for greater search of the posterior distribution, leading to more complete characterization of the posterior distribution and reducing risk of sample impoverishment. This leads to a PF that is more efficient and provides more reliable predictions. This study introduces the theory behind the proposed algorithm, with application on a hydrologic model. Results from both real and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed filter significantly increases the effectiveness of the PF, with marginal increase in the computational demand for hydrologic prediction. \textcopyright{} 2012.

We describe an implementation of the architectural technique called sub-word parallelism (SWP), which increases parallelism at the data-element-level by means of partitioning a processor's data path. The specific implementation we focus on is based on the TigerSHARC DSP architecture, developed at Analog Devices, Inc. As a result of SWP, the same data path and computation units perform more than one computation on an N-element composite word. This composite word consists of more than one adjacent sub-words. SWP is quite common and exists in production versions of most major general-purpose microprocessors. We also present an implementation of an FIR filter in the TigerSHARC using data-level SWP as an example.}

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of finite element model (FEM) updating in the context of model selection. The FEM updating problem arises from the need to update the initial FE model that does not match the measured real system outputs. This inverse system identification-problem is made even more complex by the uncertainties in modeling some of the structural parameters. Such uncertainty often results in a number of competing forms of FE models being proposed which leads to lack of consensus in the field. A model can be formulated in a number of ways; by the number, the location and the form of the updating parameters. We propose the use of a Bayesian evidence statistic to help decide on the best model from any given set of models. This statistic uses the recently developed stochastic nested sampling algorithm whose by-product is the posterior samples of the updated model parameters. Two examples of real structures are each modeled by a number of competing finite element models. The individual model evidences are compared using the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of evidences. Jeffreys scale is then used to determine the significance of the model differences obtained through the Bayes factor. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Seismic event detection and phase picking are the base of many seismological workflows. In recent years, several publications demonstrated that deep learning approaches significantly outperform classical approaches, achieving human-like performance under certain circumstances. However, as studies differ in the datasets and evaluation tasks, it is unclear how the different approaches compare to each other. Furthermore, there are no systematic studies about model performance in cross-domain scenarios, i.e., when applied to data with different characteristics. Here, we address these questions by conducting a large-scale benchmark. We compare six previously published deep learning models on eight datasets covering local to teleseismic distances and on three tasks: event detection, phase identification and onset time picking. Furthermore, we compare the results to a classical Baer-Kradolfer picker. Overall, we observe the best performance for EQTransformer, GPD and PhaseNet, with a small advantage for EQTransformer on teleseismic data. Furthermore, we conduct a cross-domain study, analyzing model performance on datasets they were not trained on. We show that trained models can be transferred between regions with only mild performance degradation, but models trained on regional data do not transfer well to teleseismic data. As deep learning for detection and picking is a rapidly evolving field, we ensured extensibility of our benchmark by building our code on standardized frameworks and making it openly accessible. This allows model developers to easily evaluate new models or performance on new datasets. Furthermore, we make all trained models available through the SeisBench framework, giving end-users an easy way to apply these models.},

  abstract = {Magmas feeding into the roots of active volcanoes contain dissolved gas. These magmas then exhibit a full range of degassing behavior, from purely passive (slow, between eruptions) to purely explosive (rapid, during explosive eruptions). Free, `leaky' passive degassing reduces though does not completely eliminate explosive potential; `tight' plugging of conduits for decades, centuries or longer favors gas accumulation and increases explosive potential, particularly if the final ascent of that magma is too fast to allow much of the accumulated gas to bleed off. Explosive magmatic eruptions reflect rapid expansion of gas bubbles to the point that the bubble walls and magma foam fragments (`blows itself apart'), just as a carbonated drink forms a foam and then a fine spray when rapidly uncorked. Parallels between active volcanoes and active faults include strain accumulation (gas accumulation), stick-slip behavior (intermittent magma ascent and eruption), creep (passive degassing), and power-law magnitude frequency relations. Unique features of volcanoes include high-temperature gases and often pronounced precursory unrest before eruptions. Unrest is especially pronounced when a magma conduit has become plugged since the previous eruption, forcing magma to pressurize and break a new path to the surface before it can erupt.},

This database, WOVOdat, is intended for reference during volcanic crises, comparative studies, basic research on pre-eruption processes, teaching, and outreach. Data are already processed to have physical meaning, e.g. earthquake hypocenters rather than voltages or arrival times, and are historical rather than real-time, ranging in age from a few days to several decades. Data from {$>$} 900 episodes of unrest covering {$>$} 75 volcanoes are already accessible. Users can visualize and compare changes from one episode of unrest or from one volcano to the next. As the database grows more complete, users will be able to analyze patterns of unrest in the same way that epidemiologists study the spatial and temporal patterns and associations among diseases. WOVOdat was opened for station and data visualization in August 2013, and now includes utilities for data downloads and Boolean searches. Many more data sets are being added, as well as utilities interfacing to new applications, e.g., the construction of event trees. For more details, please see www.wovodat.org.},

  abstract = {Volcanic crises are often preceded and accompanied by volcano deformation caused by magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Fast and efficient model identification and parameter estimation techniques for various sources of deformation are crucial for process understanding, volcano hazard assessment and early warning purposes. As a simple model that can be a basis for rapid inversion techniques, we present a compound dislocation model (CDM) that is composed of three mutually orthogonal rectangular dislocations (RDs). We present new RD solutions, which are free of artefact singularities and that also possess full rotational degrees of freedom. The CDM can represent both planar intrusions in the near field and volumetric sources of inflation and deflation in the far field. Therefore, this source model can be applied to shallow dikes and sills, as well as to deep planar and equidimensional sources of any geometry, including oblate, prolate and other triaxial ellipsoidal shapes. In either case the sources may possess any arbitrary orientation in space. After systematically evaluating the CDM, we apply it to the co-eruptive displacements of the 2015 Calbuco eruption observed by the Sentinel-1A satellite in both ascending and descending orbits. The results show that the deformation source is a deflating vertical lens-shaped source at an approximate depth of 8 km centred beneath Calbuco volcano. The parameters of the optimal source model clearly show that it is significantly different from an isotropic point source or a single dislocation model. The Calbuco example reflects the convenience of using the CDM for a rapid interpretation of deformation data.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology to compute 3-D global seismic wavefields for realistic earthquake sources in viscoelastic anisotropic media, covering applications across the observable seismic frequency band with moderate computational resources. This is accommodated by mandating axisymmetric background models that allow for a multipole expansion such that only a 2-D computational domain is needed, whereas the azimuthal third dimension is computed analytically on the fly. This dimensional collapse opens doors for storing space-time wavefields on disk that can be used to compute Fr\'echet sensitivity kernels for waveform tomography. We use the corresponding publicly available AxiSEM (www.axisem.info) open-source spectral-element code, demonstrate its excellent scalability on supercomputers, a diverse range of applications ranging from normal modes to small-scale lowermost mantle structures, tomographic models, and comparison with observed data, and discuss further avenues to pursue with this methodology. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2014.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s). We launched an array of nine freely floating submarine seismometers near the Gal\'apagos islands, which remained operational for about two years. P and PKP waves from regional and teleseismic earthquakes were observed for a range of magnitudes. The signal-to-noise ratio is strongly influenced by the weather conditions and this determines the lowest magnitudes that can be observed. Waves from deep earthquakes are easier to pick, but the S/N ratio can be enhanced through filtering and the data cover earthquakes from all depths. We measured 580 arrival times for different raypaths. We show that even such a limited number of data gives a significant increase in resolution for the oceanic upper mantle. This is the first time an array of floating seismometers is used in seismic tomography to improve the resolution significantly where otherwise no seismic information is available. We show that the Gal\'apagos Archipelago is underlain by a deep (about 1900 km) 200\textendash 300 km wide plume of high temperature, with a heat flux very much larger than predicted from its swell bathymetry. The decrease of the plume temperature anomaly towards the surface indicates that the Earth's mantle has a subadiabatic temperature gradient.},

In the early days, these problems often camefrom agricultural and industrial experiments and were relatively small inscope. With the advent of computers and the information age, statisticalproblems have exploded both in size and complexity. Challenges in theareas of data storage, organization and searching have led to the new fieldof data mining; statistical and computational problems in biology andmedicine have created bioinformatics. Vast amounts of data are beinggenerated in many fields, and the statisticians job is to make sense of itall: to extract important patterns and trends, and understand what thedata says. We call this learning from data.The challenges in learning from data have led to a revolution in the statisticalsciences. Since computation plays such a key role, it is not surprisingthat much of this new development has been done by researchers in otherfields such as computer science and engineering.The learning problems that we consider can be roughly categorized aseither supervised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the goal is to predictthe value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures;in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is todescribe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures.}

The network consists of 250 stations with a typical station spacing of similar to 40 km. Earthquake early warning is the rapid detection of an event in progress, assessment of the hazard it poses, and transmission of a warning ahead of any significant ground motion. We explore the potential for using the INSN real-time network for the purpose of earthquake early warning. We run the ElarmS early warning methodology off-line using a data set of more than 200 events with magnitudes between 2.5 and 6.0. A scaling relation for magnitude determination from the dominant period of the first seconds of signal following the P onset is developed from the data set. The standard deviation in the magnitude estimates using this approach is 0.4 magnitude units, and all event magnitude estimates are within +/- 0.75 magnitude units of the true magnitude. Given the existing distribution of seismic stations it takes an average of 10 sec after event initiation before the P wave has been detected at four stations. If we require a detection at four stations before issuing the first alert, then the blind zone, within which no warning would be available, has a radius of similar to 37 km. The ElarmS methodology can provide a warning earlier than this but with a greater uncertainty. An assessment of past damaging earthquakes across Italy shows that applying ElarmS with the existing seismic network could provide warning to population centers in repeats of past events. For example, in a repeat of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Naples could receive an similar to 15-sec warning. The variations in the size of the blind zone and warning times for different regions can be used as a guide to selecting strategic locations for future station deployments.},

  abstract = {Understanding the earthquake rupture process is central to our understanding of fault systems and earthquake hazards. Multiple hypotheses concerning the nature of fault rupture have been proposed but no unifying theory has emerged. The conceptual hypothesis most commonly cited is the cascade model for fault rupture. In the cascade model, slip initiates on a small fault patch and continues to rupture further across a fault plane as long as the conditions are favourable. Two fundamental implications of this domino-like theory are that small earthquakes begin in the same manner as large earthquakes and that the rupture process is not deterministic--that is, the size of the earthquake cannot be determined until the cessation of rupture. Here we show that the frequency content of radiated seismic energy within the first few seconds of rupture scales with the final magnitude of the event. We infer that the magnitude of an earthquake can therefore be estimated before the rupture is complete. This finding implies that the rupture process is to some degree deterministic and has implications for the physics of the rupture process.},

The method presented here, Latin hypercube sampling with dependence (LHSD), extends LHS to vectors of dependent random variables. The resulting estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically unbiased. For the bivariate case and under some conditions on the joint distribution, a central limit theorem together with a closed formula for the limit variance are derived. It is shown that for a class of estimators satisfying some monotonicity condition the LHSD limit variance is never greater than the corresponding Monte Carlo limit variance. In some valuation examples of financial payoffs, when compared to standard Monte Carlo simulation, a variance reduction of factors up to 200 is achieved. LHSD is suited for problems with rare events and for high-dimensional problems, and it may be combined with Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.},

  abstract = {The extensive harrat lava province of Arabia formed during the past 30 million years in response to Red Sea rifting and mantle upwelling. The area was regarded as seismically quiet, but between April and June 2009 a swarm of more than 30,000 earthquakes struck one of the lava fields in the province, Harrat Lunayyir, northwest Saudi Arabia. Concerned that larger damaging earthquakes might occur, the Saudi Arabian government evacuated 40,000 people from the region. Here we use geologic, geodetic and seismic data to show that the earthquake swarm resulted from magmatic dyke intrusion. We document a surface fault rupture that is 8 km long with 91 cm of offset. Surface deformation is best modelled by the shallow intrusion of a north-west trending dyke that is about 10 km long. Seismic waves generated during the earthquakes exhibit overlapping very low- and high-frequency components. We interpret the low frequencies to represent intrusion of magma and the high frequencies to represent fracturing of the crystalline basement rocks. Rather than extension being accommodated entirely by the central Red Sea rift axis, we suggest that the broad deformation observed in Harrat Lunayyir indicates that rift margins can remain as active sites of extension throughout rifting. Our analyses allowed us to forecast the likelihood of a future eruption or large earthquake in the region and informed the decisions made by the Saudi Arabian government to return the evacuees. \textcopyright{} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to present an annotated dataset of 380 user-generated videos (UGVs), 200 debunked and 180 verified, along with 5,195 near-duplicate reposted versions of them, and a set of automatic verification experiments aimed to serve as a baseline for future comparisons. Design/methodology/approach: The dataset was formed using a systematic process combining text search and near-duplicate video retrieval, followed by manual annotation using a set of journalism-inspired guidelines. Following the formation of the dataset, the automatic verification step was carried out using machine learning over a set of well-established features. Findings: Analysis of the dataset shows distinctive patterns in the spread of verified vs debunked videos, and the application of state-of-the-art machine learning models shows that the dataset poses a particularly challenging problem to automatic methods. Research limitations/implications: Practical limitations constrained the current collection to three platforms: YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Furthermore, there exists a wealth of information that can be drawn from the dataset analysis, which goes beyond the constraints of a single paper. Extension to other platforms and further analysis will be the object of subsequent research. Practical implications: The dataset analysis indicates directions for future automatic video verification algorithms, and the dataset itself provides a challenging benchmark. Social implications: Having a carefully collected and labelled dataset of debunked and verified videos is an important resource both for developing effective disinformation-countering tools and for supporting media literacy activities. Originality/value: Besides its importance as a unique benchmark for research in automatic verification, the analysis also allows a glimpse into the dissemination patterns of UGC, and possible telltale differences between fake and real content.},

Examples include large infrastructures such as the LHC in Geneva for sub-atomic particle physics or the Hubble telescope for astrophysics, as well as deeply coordinated, highly funded, decadal projects such as the Human Genome Project for life sciences. Here we argue that a similar big science approach will increasingly concern volcano science, and briefly describe three examples of developments in volcanology requiring such an approach, and that we believe will characterize the current decade (2020\textendash 2030): the Krafla Magma Testbed initiative; the development of a Global Volcano Simulator; and the emerging relevance of big data in volcano science.},

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

The earthquakes exhibit similitude between waveforms which suggests repeating source locations and processes. VLPs recorded at two permanent stations were detected using waveform semblance and were then classified into two main families (F1 and F2) using a clustering analysis. The two families are characterized by `mirror image' reverse waveform polarity suggesting that they are genetically related, but occur during different evolutionary phases of volcanic activity. F1 events occurred throughout the observation period, while F2 events mainly occurred as swarms that mark the onset of volcanic unrest. A detailed cluster analysis reveals possible sub-families implying slight temporal evolutions within a family. Our results add to our understanding of the volcanic magma\textendash hydrothermal system at Whakaari/White Island indicating that relatively stable VLP sources may be exploited to improve monitoring for future unrest.},

  abstract = {Volcanic lakes have a wide range of characteristics, and we make an attempt to delineate the limiting physical conditions for several lake classes. The ratio between heat input and heat dissipation capacity of a lake constrains the temperature for perfectly mixed steady-state volcanic lakes. Poorly mixed lakes are also conditioned by this ratio, but their temperature structure is also strongly influenced by the hydrodynamics resulting from different mechanisms of heat transfer. The steady-state temperatures of volcanic lakes are largely determined by the magnitude of the volcanic heat influx relative to the surface area of the lake. Small lakes have only a small capacity for heat dissipation and their temperature rises quickly with only small heat inputs; large lakes are buffered against variations in heat input. Both the heat dissipation and meteoric water input into a lake are functions of lake surface area and therefore each lake water temperature demands a certain precipitation rate for mass conservation, independent of lake size. The results of energy/mass-balance modeling shows that under common atmospheric conditions, most steady-state volcanic lakes are unlikely to maintain a temperature in excess of 45\textendash 50{$\mkern1mu\mkern1mu^\circ$}C. Validation of the volcanic lake model was performed using published data from Yugama Lake (Japan) and the Keli Mutu lakes (Indonesia). Also, the model was applied to 24 natural systems to provide a baseline assessment of energy fluxes under the model assumptions so future work on those systems can identify nuances in individual systems that deviate from the simple model conditions. We recommend the model for use in assessing temperature variations and volcanic lake stability in settings with known physical and atmospheric conditions. Application of the energy/mass balance calculations of model lakes provides a genetic classification scheme largely based on physical process parameters.},

  abstract = {The transferability of conceptual hydrologic models in time is often limited by both their structural deficiencies and adopted parameterizations. Adopting a stationary set of model parameters ignores biases introduced by the data used to derive them, as well as any future changes to catchment conditions. Although time invariance of model parameters is one of the hallmarks of a high quality hydrologic model, very few (if any) models can achieve this due to their inherent limitations. It is therefore proposed to consider parameters as potentially time varying quantities, which can evolve according to signals in hydrologic observations. In this paper, we investigate the potential for Data Assimilation (DA) to detect known temporal patterns in model parameters from streamflow observations. It is shown that the success of the DA algorithm is strongly dependent on the method used to generate background (or prior) parameter ensembles (also referred to as the parameter evolution model). A range of traditional parameter evolution techniques are considered and found to be problematic when multiple parameters with complex time variations are estimated simultaneously. Two alternative methods are proposed, the first is a Multilayer approach that uses the EnKF to estimate hyperparameters of the temporal structure, based on apriori knowledge of the form of nonstationarity. The second is a Locally Linear approach that uses local linear estimation and requires no assumptions of the form of parameter nonstationarity. Both are shown to provide superior results in a range of synthetic case studies, when compared to traditional parameter evolution techniques.},

The algorithm, which will serve as the official operational algorithm of the next generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R), utilizes an optimal estimation framework that allows uncertainties in the measurements and forward model to be taken into account and uncertainty estimates for each of the retrieved parameters to be determined. The retrieval approach is globally applicable because background atmospheric water vapor, surface temperature, and surface emissivity are explicitly accounted for on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The retrieval is demonstrated using the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on-board the Second Generation Meteosat. Ash clouds from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\"okull in Iceland and the 2010 eruption of Soufriere Hills in the eastern Caribbean and a Saharan dust cloud were analyzed, and the accuracy of the retrieval was evaluated using spaceborne lidar measurements. The validation analysis shows that the retrieved ash/dust cloud height, cloud emissivity, and effective particle radius generally agrees well with lidar measurements, especially when volcanic ash clouds are assumed to be composed of andesite and dust clouds composed of kaolinite.},

We created heat and fluid flow models with uniform geology and basal heat which showed that the known topography localizes convective upflows. Fourteen out of 19 known geothermal systems in the model area were correctly located beneath topographic lows. Even at 3 km depth, inclusion of topography in our models improved agreement between the locations of upflows and low-resistivity zones derived from 3-D inversion of magnetotelluric data. Therefore, while topography is not the only factor that influences geothermal convection, its contribution is on a larger scale than is generally assumed.},

In this study, we propose an approach to efficiently integrate global ordering information into model learning, where the ordering information specifies the indirect relationships among genes. We demonstrate that, compared with a traditional Bayesian network model that uses only local prior knowledge, utilising additional global ordering knowledge can significantly improve the model's performance. The magnitude of this improvement depends on abundance of global ordering information and data quality. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Over the last decades, the volume of seismic data has increased exponentially, creating a need for efficient algorithms to reliably detect and locate earthquakes. Today's most elaborate methods scan through the plethora of continuous seismic records, searching for repeating seismic signals. We leverage the recent advances in artificial intelligence and present ConvNetQuake, a highly scalable convolutional neural network for earthquake detection and location from a single waveform. We apply our technique to study the induced seismicity in Oklahoma, USA. We detect more than 17 times more earthquakes than previously cataloged by the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than established methods.},

For this purpose, Latin hypercube sampling has a long history and has shown its robustness capabilities. In this paper we propose and discuss a new algorithm to build a Latin hypercube sample (LHS) taking into account inequality constraints between the sampled variables. This technique, called constrained Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS), consists in doing permutations on an initial LHS to honor the desired monotonic constraints. The relevance of this approach is shown on a real example concerning the numerical welding simulation, where the inequality constraints are caused by the physical decreasing of some material properties in function of the temperature.},

  abstract = {Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) are considered to be an effective, pragmatic, and viable tool for seismic risk reduction in cities. While standard EEWS approaches focus on the real-time estimation of an earthquake's location and magnitude, innovative developments in EEWS include the capacity for the rapid assessment of damage. Clearly, for all public authorities that are engaged in coordinating emergency activities during and soon after earthquakes, real-time information about the potential damage distribution within a city is invaluable. In this work, we present a first attempt to design an early warning and rapid response procedure for real-time risk assessment. In particular, the procedure uses typical real-time information (i. e., P-wave arrival times and early waveforms) derived from a regional seismic network for locating and evaluating the size of an earthquake, information which in turn is exploited for extracting a risk map representing the potential distribution of damage from a dataset of predicted scenarios compiled for the target city. A feasibility study of the procedure is presented for the city of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, which is surrounded by the Kyrgyz seismic network by mimicking the ground motion associated with two historical events that occurred close to Bishkek, namely the 1911 Kemin (M = 8. 2; {$\pm$}0. 2) and the 1885 Belovodsk (M = 6. 9; {$\pm$}0. 5) earthquakes. Various methodologies from previous studies were considered when planning the implementation of the early warning and rapid response procedure for real-time risk assessment: the Satriano et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 98(3):1482-1494, 2008) approach to real-time earthquake location; the Caprio et al. (Geophys Res Lett 38:L02301, 2011) approach for estimating moment magnitude in real time; the EXSIM method for ground motion simulation (Motazedian and Atkinson, Bull Seismol Soc Am 95:995-1010, 2005); the Sokolov (Earthquake Spectra 161: 679-694, 2002) approach for estimating intensity from Fourier amplitude spectra; and the Tyagunov et al. (Nat Hazard Earth Syst Sci 6:573-586, 2006) approach for risk computation. Innovatively, all these methods are jointly applied to assess in real time the seismic risk of a particular target site, namely the city of Bishkek. Finally, the site amplification and vulnerability datasets considered in the proposed methodology are taken from previous studies, i. e., Parolai et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am, 2010) and Bindi et al. (Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 2011), respectively. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of volcanology is forecasting hazardous eruptive activity. Despite much progress over the last century, however, volcanoes still erupt with no detected precursors, lives and livelihoods are lost to eruptive activity, and forecasting the onsets of eruptions remains fraught with uncertainty. Long-term forecasts are generally derived from the geological and historical records, from which recurrence intervals and styles of activity can be inferred, while shorter-term forecasts are derived from patterns in monitoring data. Information from geology and monitoring data can be evaluated and combined using statistical analysis, expert elicitation, and conceptual and or mathematical models. Integrative frameworks, such as event trees, combine this diversity of information to produce probabilistic forecasts that can inform the style and scale of the societal response to a potential future eruption. Several developments show promise to revolutionize the utility and accuracy of these forecasts. These include growth in the quantity and quality of multidisciplinary monitoring data, coupled with increases in computing power; machine learning algorithms, which will allow far better utilization of this growing volume of data; and new physiochemical volcano models and data assimilation algorithms, which take advantage of a wide range of monitoring data and realistic physics to better predict the evolution of a given physical state. Although eruption forecasts may never be as generally~reliable as weather forecasts, and great caution must be exercised when attempting to predict highly complex volcanic behavior, these and other innovations\textemdash particularly when combined in integrative, fully probabilistic forecasting frameworks\textemdash should help volcanologists to better issue warnings of volcanic activity on societally relevant time frames.},

By taking a Bayesian probabilistic perspective, we provide a number of insights into more efficient algorithms for optimisation and hyper-parameter tuning. Traditional high-dimensional data reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), reduced rank regression (RRR), projection pursuit regression (PPR) are all shown to be shallow learners. Their deep learning counterparts exploit multiple deep layers of data reduction which provide predictive performance gains. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training optimisation and Dropout (DO) regularization provide estimation and variable selection. Bayesian regularization is central to finding weights and connections in networks to optimize the predictive bias-variance trade-off. To illustrate our methodology, we provide an analysis of international bookings on Airbnb. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.},

This paradigm has also been adopted by the theory of artificial neural networks. Recent physiological experiments demonstrate, however, that in many parts of the nervous system, neural code is founded on the timing of individual action potentials. This finding has given rise to the emergence of a new class of neural models, called spiking neural networks. In this paper we summarize basic properties of spiking neurons and spiking networks. Our focus is, specifically, on models of spike-based information coding, synaptic plasticity and learning. We also survey real-life applications of spiking models. The paper is meant to be an introduction to spiking neural networks for scientists from various disciplines interested in spike-based neural processing.},

  abstract = {Caldera unrest occurs frequently at Taupo Volcanic Centre (TVC), New Zealand, occasionally resulting in deleterious socio-economic impacts. This large silicic volcano most recently erupted in 232~AD in an explosive, caldera-forming rhyolitic eruption, devastating the central North Island. Eruptions are preceded by volcanic unrest, often consisting of seismicity, deformation, degassing, and/or geothermal system changes. These phenomena may also occur due to non-magmatic processes, complicating eruption forecasting. As volcanic unrest may or may not lead to an eruption, it needs to be characterised to provide effective warnings; this is best achieved by understanding past unrest. In this research, a catalogue of caldera unrest at TVC is developed using an historical chronology methodology, spanning from 1872 to December 2011. The Volcanic Unrest Index (VUI), which is introduced by Potter et al. (2015), is estimated for the catalogue, demonstrating its use and providing a characterisation of unrest at TVC. Sixteen episodes of unrest are identified; 4 are classified as moderate unrest (VUI 3), and 12 are classified as minor unrest (VUI 2). There has been median interval of approximately 3~years between unrest episodes and a median unrest episode duration of just under 5~months. This research provides context for future caldera unrest crises at TVC and contributes to the global caldera unrest dataset.},

Many hydrometeorological agencies are moving toward impact-based forecast and warning (IBFW) systems, as encouraged by the World Meteorological Organization. Yet little research has been conducted on such systems from the perspectives of agencies who are or would be involved in their implementation. We investigated the challenges and benefits of IBFW systems as perceived by participants from agencies internationally and within New Zealand. Interviews and workshops were held with meteorologists and weather forecasters, flood forecasters and hydrologists, and emergency managers. We found that the benefits of implementing IBFW systems included a perceived increase in the understanding of the potential impacts by the public, added awareness of antecedent conditions by forecasters, a possible reduction in ``false alarms,'' and increased interagency communication. Challenges identified by the participants included whether the system should be designed for individuals or society, a lack of impact data, verification of warnings based on impacts, a conflict with roles and responsibilities, the potential for conflicting messages, and the increased burden on agencies providing information to forecasters with a perception of little benefit in return. We argue that IBFWs could be designed for individual members of the public, with an increased focus on understanding vulnerability and capacities, and that more impact data need to be collected and stored to inform future warnings. Increased interagency coordination would assist with rapid decision-making and the success of IBFWs.},

  abstract = {During volcanic eruptions, aviation stakeholders require an assessment of the volcanic ash hazard. Operators and regulators are required to make fast decisions based on deterministic forecasts, which are subject to various sources of uncertainty. For a robust decision to be made, a measure of the uncertainty of the hazard should be considered, but this can lead to added complexity preventing fast decision-making. A proof-of-concept risk-matrix approach is presented that combines uncertainty estimation and volcanic ash hazard forecasting into a simple warning system for aviation. To demonstrate the methodology, an ensemble of 600 dispersion model simulations is used to characterize uncertainty (due to eruption source parameters, meteorology and internal model parameters) in ash dosages and concentrations for a hypothetical Icelandic eruption. To simulate aircraft encounters with volcanic ash, trans-Atlantic air routes between New York (JFK) and London (LHR) are generated using time-optimal routing software. This approach was developed in collaboration with operators, regulators and engine manufacturers; it demonstrates how an assessment of ash dosage and concentration risk can be used to make fast and robust flight-planning decisions, even when the model uncertainty spans several orders of magnitude. The results highlight the benefit of using an ensemble over a deterministic forecast and a new method for visualizing dosage risk along flight paths. The risk-matrix approach is applicable to other aviation hazards such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) dosages, desert dust, aircraft icing and clear-air turbulence, and is expected to aid flight-planning decisions by improving the communication of ensemble-based forecasts to aviation.},

  abstract = {At 11:18 h (New Zealand time, GMT +12) on 18 March 2007 an impoundment of 0.01 \texttimes{} 106 m3 of tephra collapsed, releasing 1.3 \texttimes{} 106 m3 of water from Crater Lake at 2536 m elevation on Mount Ruapehu. The lahar traveled 200 km along the Whangaehu River. Aerial LiDAR surveys of the upper 62 km of flow path were made before and after the lahar. We present here the first large-scale quantification of the geomorphic impact of the dam-break flood along with the rates and controls on its sediment entrainment and deposition. The flood mobilized a net value of 2.5-3.1 \texttimes{} 106 m3 of boulders, gravel, and sand over the first 5 km of travel to form a lahar of at least 4.4 \texttimes{} 106 m3 passing instruments at 6.9 km. LiDAR volume-transfer calculations match dynamic measurements made. After a logarithmic increase in cumulative net sediment entrainment, the lahar appeared to reach its maximum sediment-carrying capacity at 22 km. Patterns of alternating sediment erosion and deposition occurred that dominantly reflect a combination of channel morphology and confinement on the local sediment-carrying capacity of the flow. \textcopyright{} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright 2018. American Geophysical Union. Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems' performance is driven by the trade-off between the need for a rapid alert and the accuracy of each solution. A challenge for many EEW systems has been the magnitude saturation for large events (M W {$>$} 7) and the resulting underestimation of seismic moment magnitude. In this study, we test the performance of high-rate (1 Hz) GPS, based on seven seismic events, to evaluate whether long-period ground motions can be measured well enough to infer reliably earthquake predominant periods. We show that high-rate GPS data allow the computation of a GPS-based predominant period ({$\tau$} g ) to estimate lower bounds for the magnitude of earthquakes and distinguish between large (M W {$>$} 7) and great (M W {$>$} 8) events and thus extend the capability of EEW systems for larger events. It has also identified the impact of the different values of the smoothing factor {$\alpha$} on the {$\tau$} g results and how the sampling rate and the computation process differentiate {$\tau$} g from the commonly used {$\tau$} p .},

  abstract = {Accelerating the data acquisition of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging leads to a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, which has received great interest from both the signal processing and machine learning communities over the last decades. The key ingredient to the problem is how to exploit the temporal correlations of the MR sequence to resolve aliasing artifacts. Traditionally, such observation led to a formulation of an optimization problem, which was solved using iterative algorithms. Recently, however, deep learning-based approaches have gained significant popularity due to their ability to solve general inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a unique, novel convolutional recurrent neural network architecture which reconstructs high quality cardiac MR images from highly undersampled k-space data by jointly exploiting the dependencies of the temporal sequences as well as the iterative nature of the traditional optimization algorithms. In particular, the proposed architecture embeds the structure of the traditional iterative algorithms, efficiently modeling the recurrence of the iterative reconstruction stages by using recurrent hidden connections over such iterations. In addition, spatio-temporal dependencies are simultaneously learnt by exploiting bidirectional recurrent hidden connections across time sequences. The proposed method is able to learn both the temporal dependence and the iterative reconstruction process effectively with only a very small number of parameters, while outperforming current MR reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and speed.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge\textendash Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction\textendash diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

It implements algorithms discussed in Rasmussen \& Williams: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning , the MIT press, 2006 and Nickisch \& Rasmussen: Approximations for Binary Gaussian Process Classification , JMLR, 2008. The strength of the function lies in its flexibility, simplicity and extensibility. The function is flexible as firstly it allows specification of the properties of the GP through definition of mean func- tion and covariance functions. Secondly, it allows specification of different inference procedures, such as e.g. exact inference and Expectation Propagation (EP). Thirdly it allows specification of likelihood functions e.g. Gaussian or Laplace (for regression) and e.g. cumulative Logistic (for classification). Simplicity is achieved through a single function and compact code. Extensibility is ensured by modular design allowing for easy addition of extension for the already fairly extensive libraries for inference methods, mean functions, covariance functions and likelihood functions. This document is a technical manual for a developer containing many details. If you are not yet familiar with the GPML toolbox, the user documentation and examples therein are a better way to get started.},

Part II is devoted to Bayesian filtering algorithms, from classical data assimilation algorithms such as the Kalman filter, variational techniques, and sequential Monte Carlo methods, through to more recent developments such as the ensemble Kalman filter and ensemble transform filters. The McKean approach to sequential filtering in combination with coupling of measures serves as a unifying mathematical framework throughout Part II.

  abstract = {The occurrence of earthquakes in the lower crust near continental rifts has long been puzzling, as the lower crust is generally thought to be too hot for brittle failure to occur. Such anomalous events have usually been explained in terms of the lower crust being cooler than normal. But if the lower crust is indeed cold enough to produce earthquakes, then the uppermost mantle beneath it should also be cold enough, and yet uppermost mantle earthquakes are not observed. Numerous lower-crustal earthquakes occur near the southwestern termination of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), an active continental rift in New Zealand. Here we present three-dimensional tomographic imaging of seismic velocities and seismic attenuation in this region using data from a dense seismograph deployment. We find that crustal earthquakes accurately relocated with our three-dimensional seismic velocity model form a continuous band along the rift, deepening from mostly less than 10 km in the central TVZ to depths of 30-40 km in the lower crust, 30 km southwest of the termination of the volcanic zone. These earthquakes often occur in swarms, suggesting fluid movement in critically loaded fault zones. Seismic velocities within the band are also consistent with the presence of fluids, and the deepening seismicity parallels the boundary between high seismic attenuation (interpreted as partial melt) within the central TVZ and low seismic attenuation in the crust to the southwest. This linking of upper and lower-crustal seismicity and crustal structure allows us to propose a common explanation for all the seismicity, involving the weakening of faults on the periphery of an otherwise dry, mafic crust by hot fluids, including those exsolved from underlying melt. Such fluids may generally be an important driver of lower-crustal seismicity near continental rifts.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

This study examines participation rates by non-citizens using a nationally representative sample that includes non-citizen immigrants. We find that some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections. Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.},

To efficiently share data, it is important that different data providers follow a common format. The Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data (SEED) provides one such format for storing seismic and other geophysical data. The SEED format is widely used in earthquake seismology; however, SEED and its structure can be difficult for many first-time users (ourselves included). Below is a quick tutorial that outlines the basic structure of SEED format. This write-up is in no way intended to replace the comprehensive SEED manual (Ahern et al. , 2009), and instead of going into the details of any specific part of the SEED format we refer the reader to the manual for additional details. The goal of this write-up is to succinctly explain the basic structure of SEED format as well as the associated jargon, as most commonly used now, in a colloquial way so that novice users of SEED can become more familiar with the format and its application quickly. Our goal is to give the reader the necessary background so that when problems or questions about SEED format arise they will have some understanding of where they should look for more details or from where the problem might be stemming. As a secondary goal, we hope to help the reader become familiar with the SEED manual (Ahern et al. , 2009), which contains detailed information about all aspects of the SEED format. SEED format logically breaks down into the part containing time-series data, called miniSEED, and the other stuff, which is called dataless SEED \ldots}

Explosions were recorded at Stromboli using a small aperture array of 4 infrasonic stations, allowing precise vent location. The acoustic signals were delayed-and-summed, revealing the existence of two main groups of infrasonic waves. The NE crater produces short ({$<$}3 s) high amplitude (20\textendash 80 Pa) pressure waves while the SW crater produces small acoustic pressure (10\textendash 30 Pa) with long (5\textendash 15 s) coda. The two groups reflect different in explosive styles and similar spectral content, centered on 5\textendash 6 Hz. When stacked together, acoustic waveforms for each crater reveal the same pressure pulse, which indicates a common source process. We infer that the acoustic onset at both craters is generated by the burst of a large gas bubble while the acoustic coda is controlled by a sustained pressure release.},

Conservation management of the Eastern gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population through the regulation of whale watching in the lagoon Ojo de Liebre, Mexico, is a useful example of policy-making challenged by lack of scientific knowledge regarding the negative long-term effects of whale watching. We present a pragmatic ap- proach to provide Mexican authorities the technical information they need to justify the establishment of a maximum number of boats under conditions of deep uncertainty. Operationally, our approach combines system dynamics modelling, to simulate the boats' impact on the breeding habitat, with ecological risk assessment, to determine the probability of crossing a critical ecological threshold, which is associated to a risk of severely reducing the gray whale abundance in the lagoon. Thus, our approach addresses the issue of establishing a legal maximum number of boats to protect threatened species. 1.},

  abstract = {Large-scale landslide prediction is typically based on numerical modeling, with computer codes generally involving a large number of input parameters. Addressing the influence of each of them on the final result and providing a ranking procedure may be useful for risk management purposes. This can be performed by a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, such an analysis requires a large number of computer code simulations, which appears impracticable for computationally demanding simulations, with computation times ranging from several hours to several days. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a ``meta-model''-based strategy consisting in replacing the complex simulator by a ``statistical approximation'' provided by a Gaussian-process (GP) model. This allows computation of sensitivity measures from a limited number of simulations. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is used to rank in terms of importance the properties of the elastoplastic model describing the complex behavior of the slip surface in the La Frasse landslide (Switzerland). One limitation of the GP-based methodology is that the computation of sensitivity measures is associated with uncertainty as the simulator is approximated using a training sample of small size, i.e., a limited knowledge on the ``true'' simulator. This source of uncertainty can be taken into account by treating the GP model from a Bayesian perspective. This provides the full posterior probability distribution associated with the sensitivity measures, which can be summarized by a confidence interval to outline the regions where the GP model is ``unsure.'' We show that this methodology is able to provide useful guidelines for the practical decision-making process and suggest further site investigations.},

The main explosive eruption consisted of two eruption pulses (lasting \textasciitilde 1.5 and 6h each one) on 22 and 23 April, producing stratospheric ({$>$}15km height) eruption columns. The erupted materials correspond to porphyritic basaltic andesite (\textasciitilde 55wt.\% of SiO2). The tephra fall affected mainly the area northeast of the volcano and the finest ash was deposited over Southern Chile and Patagonia Argentina. We studied the tephra fall deposits of both pulses in terms of stratigraphy, distribution, volume, emplacement dynamics and eruption source parameters. Here, we show field observations that have been made 5\textendash 470km downwind and distinguish five layers (Layers A, B, B1, C and D) representing different stages of the eruption evolution: eruption onset (Layer A; pulse 1), followed by the first paroxysmal event (Layer B; pulse 1), in some places interbedded by layer B1, tentatively representing the sedimentation of a secondary plume during the end of pulse 1. We recognized a second paroxysm (Layer C; pulse 2) followed by the waning of the eruption (Layer D; pulse 2). The total calculated bulk tephra fall deposit volume is 0.27{$\pm$}0.007km3 (0.11\textendash 0.13km3 dense rock equivalent), 38\% of which was erupted during the first phase and 62\% during the second pulse.

  abstract = {To optimally monitor earthquake-generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large magnitude events. Here we show that with deep learning we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases, even when masked by high background noise, and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that is not represented in the training set (in particular, very large magnitude events). This generalized phase detection (GPD) framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.},

The networks are trained on 18.2 million manually picked seismograms for the Southern California region. Through cross validation on 1.2 million independent seismograms, the differences between the automated and manual picks have a standard deviation of 0.023~s. The polarities determined by the classifier have a precision of 95\% when compared with analyst-determined polarities. We show that the classifier picks more polarities overall than the analysts, without sacrificing quality, resulting in almost double the number of focal mechanisms. The remarkable precision of the trained networks indicates that they can perform as well, or better, than expert seismologists.},

  abstract = {Seismic phase association is a fundamental task in seismology that pertains to linking together phase detections on different sensors that originate from a common earthquake. It is widely employed to detect earthquakes on permanent and temporary seismic networks, and underlies most seismicity catalogs produced around the world. This task can be challenging because the number of sources is unknown, events frequently overlap in time, or can occur simultaneously in different parts of a network. We present PhaseLink, a framework based on recent advances in deep learning for grid-free earthquake phase association. Our approach learns to link phases together that share a common origin, and is trained entirely on tens of millions of synthetic sequences of P- and S-wave arrival times generated using a simple 1D velocity model. Our approach is simple to implement for any tectonic regime, suitable for real-time processing, and can naturally incorporate errors in arrival time picks. Rather than tuning a set of ad hoc hyperparameters to improve performance, PhaseLink can be improved by simply adding examples of problematic cases to the training dataset. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PhaseLink on a challenging recent sequence from southern California, and synthesized sequences from Japan designed to test the point at which the method fails. For the examined datasets, PhaseLink can precisely associate P- and S-picks to events that are separated by \textasciitilde 12 seconds in origin time. This approach is expected to improve the resolution of seismicity catalogs, add stability to real-time seismic monitoring, and streamline automated processing of large seismic datasets.},

Variations in lake volume over time were approximately determined from digitized photographic views of the lake using an empirical relationship between depth of the lake and surface area, obtained after four bathymetric surveys. The best correlation between the observed changes in lake volume, Cl content and the measured flow rate of Soap Pool was obtained by a box-model for the Cl mass balance.

Their geyser-like behaviour with a long-term (months to years) periodicity is due to a specific geometry of the shallow boiling aquifer beneath the lake, which is the remnant of the 1983 Cl-rich (24,000~mg/l) crater lake water. The Soap Pool springs decreased in Cl content over time. The zero-time extrapolation (1982, year of the eruption) approaches the Cl content in the initial crater lake, meanwhile the extrapolation towards the future indicates a zero-Cl content by 2009{$\pm$}1. This particular situation offers the opportunity to calculate mass balance and Cl budget to quantify the lake\textendash spring system in the El Chich\'on crater. These calculations show that the water balance without the input of SP springs is negative, implying that the lake should disappear during the dry season. The isotopic composition of lake waters ({$\delta$}D and {$\delta$}18O) coincide with this crater lake-SP dynamics, reflecting evaporation processes and mixing with SP geyser and meteoric water. Future dome growth, not observed yet in the post-1982 El Chich\'on crater, may be anticipated by changes in lake chemistry and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Seismic and geochemical data collected at Po\'as volcano, Costa Rica, since 1978 suggest that temperature and chemical variations recorded in subaerial fumaroles and the crater lake are related to episodic release of heat and volatiles associated with hydrofracturing of the upper margin of the shallow magma body. Power outputs associated with these events approach 600 MW and are superimposed on a baseline energy flux of approximately 200 MW. The baseline heat flux suggests a magma solidification rate of 0.012 km3/yr and background volatile release rates of 1000 t/d H2O, 66 t/d, S, 13 t/d Cl, and 0.5 t/d F. These fluxes are comparable to fluxes of F, Cl and S exiting the magmatic/hydrothermal system through acidic flank springs and are about a factor of five less than estimated volatile fluxes through summit fumaroles during the high-temperature event of 1981\textendash 1983. Mass balance considerations suggest that heat released at the lake surface is primarily supplied by the ascent of heated brines supplemented by condensation of fumarolic steam. Calculated average seepage rates out of the lake ({$\approx$} 450 kg/s) indicate rapid convection of acidic lake brine through underlying lake sediments and pyroclastic deposits. Circulation of the extremely corrosive lake brine through the volcanoelastic material beneath the lake may enhance subsurface permeabilities. Fluxes of rock-forming elements observed in the Rio Agrio basin on the northwest flank of Po\'as suggest that dissolution and removal of volcano-elastic material occurs at a rate of approximately 1650 m3/yr. However, estimated sulfur fluxes from the cooling magma body suggest that porosity created by this dissolution could quickly be filled by the deposition of native sulfur. Finally,analysis of heat and water budgets for the crater lake over the period 1978\textendash 1989 indicates that the recent decline and disappearance of the lake was caused by variations in summit rainfall combined with an increase in subsurface heat flow to the lake in 1987\textendash 1988. The increase in heat flow is related to continued degassing of high-temperature volatiles following a hydrofracturing/magma ascent episode that occurred in 1986.},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

  abstract = {The recent development of fixed networks of scanning ultraviolet spectrometers for automatic determination of volcanic SO2 fluxes has created tremendous opportunities for monitoring volcanoes but has brought new challenges in processing (and interpreting) the copious data flow they produce. A particular difficulty in standard implantation of differential optical absorption (DOAS) methods is the requirement for a clear-sky (plume-free) background spectrum. Our experience after four years of measurements with two UV scanner networks on Etna and Stromboli shows that wide plumes are frequently observed, precluding simple selection of clear-sky spectra. We have therefore developed a retrieval approach based on simulation of the background spectrum. We describe the method here and tune it empirically by collecting clear, zenith sky spectra using calibration cells containing known amounts of SO2. We then test the performance of this optimised retrieval using clear-sky spectra collected with the same calibration cells but for variable scan angles, time of day, and season (through the course of 1~year), finding acceptable results (\textasciitilde{} 12\% error) for SO2 column amounts. We further illustrate the analytical approach using spectra recorded at Mt. Etna during its July 2006 eruption. We demonstrate the reliability of the method for tracking volcano dynamics on different time scales, and suggest it is widely suited to automated SO2-plume monitoring. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Each instrument allows one SO2 scan to be recorded every \textasciitilde 6 min. Here we report the methods that we developed to automatically and robustly transform SO2 profiles into SO2 flux data. Radian geometry and Fast Fourier Transform algorithm were used for reducing plume cross-sections and for discriminating between volcanic plumes from those produced by water vapour clouds. Uncertainty in flux measurements depends on the accuracy of plume-height estimation, on assumptions concerning plume-geometry, and on the quality of the retrieved SO2 amounts. We compare 3 years of flux measurements made using both the automated network and "conventional" traverse methods beneath the plume. We found a good agreement between the datasets, both in terms of magnitude and in temporal variations. These results validate the Etna SO2 flux monitoring system. Emission rates are available to the 24-hour manned operations room via intranet, providing real-time information on degassing rates and plume location. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo direct search methods, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc., are often used to explore a finite-dimensional parameter space. They require the solving of the forward problem many times, that is, making predictions of observables from an earth model. The resulting ensemble of earth models represents all 'information' collected in the search process. Search techniques have been the subject of much study in geophysics; less attention is given to the appraisal of the ensemble. Often inferences are based on only a small subset of the ensemble, and sometimes a single member. This paper presents a new approach to the appraisal problem. To our knowledge this is the first time the general case has been addressed, that is, how to infer information from a complete ensemble, previously generated by any search method. The essence of the new approach is to use the information in the available ensemble to guide a resampling of the parameter space. This requires no further solving of the forward problem, but from the new 'resampled' ensemble we are able to obtain measures of resolution and trade-off in the model parameters, or any combinations of them. The new ensemble inference algorithm is illustrated on a highly non-linear waveform inversion problem. It is shown how the computation time and memory requirements scale with the dimension of the parameter space and size of the ensemble. The method is highly parallel, and may easily be distributed across several computers. Since little is assumed about the initial ensemble of earth models, the technique is applicable to a wide variety of situations. For example, it may be applied to perform 'error analysis' using the ensemble generated by a genetic algorithm, or any other direct search method.},

A model is defined to be data acceptable if its fit to the observed data is better than some prescribed level. The neighbourhood algorithm (NA) can be used to generate ensembles of models which preferentially sample the data-acceptable regions of parameter space. Simple transformations of a data misfit criterion are proposed to assist in this task. Some numerical experiments are presented which are motivated by highly nonlinear geophysical inverse problems. In these cases it is shown how the NA can be used to map out the main features of data-acceptable regions in both high-and low-dimensional problems. It is also shown how the NA can concentrate sampling in multiple acceptable regions simultaneously.}

It is based on an integral representation of the diffracted elastic fields in terms of single-layer boundary sources that is derived from Somigliana's identity. Introduction of boundary conditions leads to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for boundary sources. A discretization scheme based on the numerical and analytical integration of exact Green's functions for displacements and tractions is employed. Calculations are performed in the frequency domain and synthetic seismograms are obtained using the fast Fourier transform. In order to give perspective on the range of effects caused by topographic anomalies, various examples that cover extreme cases are presented. -from Authors}

The duration of the three datasets which are comprised of MODIS LST images is 44, 28 and 46 days for the Bam, Zarand and Borujerd earthquakes, re-spectively. In order to exclude variations of LST from tem-perature seasonal effects, Air Temperature (AT) data derived from the meteorological stations close to the earthquakes epi-centers have been taken into account. The detection of ther-mal anomalies has been assessed using interquartile, wavelet transform and Kalman filter methods, each presenting its own independent property in anomaly detection. The in-terquartile method has been used to construct the higher and lower bounds in LST data to detect disturbed states outside the bounds which might be associated with impending earth-quakes. The wavelet transform method has been used to locate local maxima within each time series of LST data for identifying earthquake anomalies by a predefined thresh-old. Also, the prediction property of the Kalman filter has been used in the detection process of prominent LST anoma-lies. The results concerning the methodology indicate that the interquartile method is capable of detecting the highest intensity anomaly values, the wavelet transform is sensitive to sudden changes, and the Kalman filter method signifi-cantly detects the highest unpredictable variations of LST. The three methods detected anomalous occurrences during 1 to 20 days prior to the earthquakes showing close agree-ment in results found between the different applied methods on LST data in the detection of pre-seismic anomalies. The proposed method for anomaly detection was also applied on regions irrelevant to earthquakes for which no anomaly was Correspondence to: M.

  abstract = {In this paper, various comparisons among well-known equations of the convection heat transfer coefficient for forced air flow over flat surfaces and particularly over flat plate solar collectors, with the aim at arriving at a consensus on which of such equations is more accurate are carried out. Through the application of basic principles, various accuracies, inaccuracies and validations of the considered equations have been found and shown, and a consensus reached. Such consensual equation, which comes from the boundary layer theory and takes into account the determining laminar and turbulent flows as well as the wind direction and the decay of the convection coefficient over the surface, also showed close agreement with different experimental works and tends to represent more accurately the actual heat transfer from/to any flat surface submitted to forced convection.},

Since up to now there had not been a consensus on which equations were better to employ, a large scattering of evaporation rates has been found. Several theoretical criteria have been undertaken, the scattering has been eliminated and a consensus has been reached. It has also been shown that the consensual equations account for average roughness over the free water surface length and tend to better predict the actual evaporation rate. Pan evaporation may generate considerable differences in relation to a large water surface evaporation, depending on the surface length and the rate of mass transfer.},

  abstract = {We present a new coherence functional to evaluate quantitatively the goodness of waveform fit between two time series as function of lag time. The proposed coherence measure is called phase cross-correlation (PCC) because it is based on the similarity of instantaneous phases. No amplitudes are explicitly involved, and PCC is therefore an amplitude unbiased measure, which equally weights every sample in the correlation window. As consequence PCC enables to discriminate between closely similar waveforms and is suited to detect weak arrivals that are concealed in larger amplitude signals. Besides, for signal recognition PCC can be applied for arrival time picking, as a misfit function, or it can be used in combination with stacking techniques. The performance of PCC is illustrated and discussed in comparison with the conventional cross-correlation normalized with the geometric mean energy. Both measures are based on different concepts, and the differences in their performance can be significant. The choice of the proper coherence measure depends on the data and application. We show in a data example the ability of PCC to detect weak P-to-s conversions in the P-wave coda of teleseismic events. With this example we give confirming evidence for a crust that is thicker than the global average and for the existence of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities underneath SE Brazil. In addition, we observe hints of a 510-km discontinuity.}

  abstract = {Based on the results obtained by analysing a large number of dynamic strike slip and dipping fault ruptures we construct a kinematic rupture model generator that incorporates some of the key source parameters extracted from the dynamic rupture models. In this kinematic rupture model, the slip rate function includes the final slip, the rise time, the local rupture velocity and the peak time (a measure of the impulsive part of the slip rate function). A four-dimensional correlation matrix is used to describe the spatial interdependency between the four source parameters\textemdash each of which is modelled as correlated random field. Each source parameter has a different marginal distribution determined from the analysis of the dynamic models. The marginal distributions are allowed to change as a function of distance from the hypocentre. The autocorrelation of each parameter is modelled by a power spectrum that follows a power law. The value of the spectral decay of the power law for the different source parameters is based on the results obtained from the dynamic rupture models. Finally, the values of rise time and peak time are adjusted such that the moment rate function fits a Brune spectrum for a specified corner frequency. We validate the rupture model generator using observed strong motion near field recording for the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. We perform comparisons with the rupture model generator of Liu et al. We find that only considering the response spectral bias of a best model is not sufficient to validate a rupture model generator. Thus we test the predictive power of the two rupture model generators if multiple ruptures are computed. Overall, the new rupture model generator yields a better prediction, compared to Liu et al., for the two validation events, especially in predicting observed PGV values and pseudospectral velocity at low frequencies ({$<$}1 Hz).},

  abstract = {Climate projections continue to be marred by large uncertainties, which originate in processes that need to be parameterized, such as clouds, convection, and ecosystems. But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

  abstract = {Climate projections continue to be marred by large uncertainties, which originate in processes that need to be parameterized, such as clouds, convection, and ecosystems. But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both and quantifies uncertainties. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

  abstract = {Frying Pan and Inferno Crater lakes occupy craters formed on 10 June 1886 during the Tarawera Rift eruption. These lakes are the largest and most spectacular hot springs in New Zealand, and together they display interrelated cyclic variations about a 38 day cycle. The lake occupying Inferno Crater fluctuates from overflow to about 8 m below overflow, although exceptionally the water level has receded below 12 m, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than other known geyser like hot springs. The temperature fluctuates sympathetically with the water level in the range 35.0 to 84.5\textdegree C. Four distinct stages are recognised with the following average parameters; the first lasts 7.7 days, water level and temperature rise respectively 4.7m and 17.3\textdegree C, while the lake volume increases by 23 800 m3. The second lasts 14.7 days, water level rises 3.99 m, the temperature remains steady about 60.7\textdegree C, lake volume increases 22 000 m3. The third is an overflow of 79.1 litre sec-1 for 51.3 hours peaking at 70.6\textdegree C. In the fourth stage, lake level recedes 7.9m decreasing lake volume 45 800 m3 over 15.1 days, and the lake temperature falls 26.4\textdegree C. The discharge of nearby Frying Pan Lake varies inversely with the water level of Inferno Crater Lake by 20.2 {$\pm$} 2.7 litre sec-1 and also responds to a previously unrecognised cycle of about 20 days duration. The temperature of the discharge also responds to the 20 and 38 day cycles, but shows no correlation with discharge volume. Ambient air temperature strongly influences the discharge temperature, which ranges annually between 44.3\textdegree C and 56.6\textdegree C with a mean of 50.1\textdegree C. A slight decrease of about 1.4\textdegree C is apparent between 1972 and 1990. The mean annual discharge from Frying Pan Lake has decreased from 122.2 to 104.1 litre sec-1 between 1972 and 1990. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a wavelet-based filtering for soil CO2 flux time series. The filter relies on the detection of the periodic components achieved by means of the long-term time-frequency characterization of the time series. For this purpose, we exploited the vast data set coming from the monitoring network installed at Mt. Etna volcano (Italy). The network provides hourly measure of CO2 flux together with the measure of the climatic variables. These data allow to investigate the relationships between CO2 time series and the potentially influencing meteorological factors. This has been assessed calculating the wavelet coherence between CO2 time series against air temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity in all the sites where these information were available. Results highlight the occurrence of marked cycles at about {$\sim$}1 year for the most of the sites while shorter cycles occur only at some sites. From these cycles a periodic signal can be calculated, and therefore opportunely removed from the time CO2 series to enhance the volcano-related anomalies. We found also common cycles among CO2 and the climatic variables, which synchronicity is constant over time but it is site-specific. Starting from this consideration, we calculated a reference signal for CO2 combining analytically the temperature, the pressure, and the humidity cycles: this model of the climatic effect has been used to predict the seasonal trend of the CO2 output.},

  abstract = {S U M M A R Y In geophysical inversion, inferences of Earth's properties from sparse data involve a trade-off between model complexity and the spatial resolving power. A recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) technique formalized by Green, the so-called trans-dimensional samplers, allows us to sample between these trade-offs and to parsimoniously arbitrate between the varying complexity of candidate models. Here we present a novel framework using trans-dimensional sampling over tree structures. This new class of McMC sampler can be applied to 1-D, 2-D and 3-D Cartesian and spherical geometries. In addition, the basis functions used by the algorithm are flexible and can include more advanced parametrizations such as wavelets, both in Cartesian and Spherical geometries, to permit Bayesian multiscale analysis. This new framework offers greater flexibility, performance and efficiency for geophysical imaging problems than previous sampling algorithms. Thereby increasing the range of applications and in particular allowing extension to trans-dimensional imaging in 3-D. Examples are presented of its application to 2-D seismic and 3-D teleseismic tomography including estimation of uncertainty.},

Modern technology permits measurements of strong ground shaking in near real-time for urban areas exposed to earthquake risk. The Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response System equipped with 100 instruments and two data processing centers aims at the near real time estimation of earthquake damages using most recently developed methodologies and up-to-date structural and demographic inventories of Istanbul city. The methodology developed for near real time estimation of losses after a major earthquake consists of the following general steps: (1) rapid estimation of the ground motion distribution using the strong ground motion data gathered from the instruments; (2) improvement of the ground motion estimations as earthquake parameters become available and (3) estimation of building damage and casualties based on estimated ground motions and intensities. The present paper elaborates on the ground motion and damage estimation methodologies used by the Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response System with a special emphasis on validation and verification of the different methods. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Potential impact of large earthquakes on urban societies can be reduced by timely and correct action after a disastrous earthquake. Modern technology permits measurements of strong ground shaking in near real-time for urban areas exposed to earthquake risk. The Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response System equipped with 100 instruments and two data processing centers aims at the near real time estimation of earthquake damages using most recently developed methodologies and up-to-date structural and demographic inventories of Istanbul city. The methodology developed for near real time estimation of losses after a major earthquake consists of the following general steps: (1) rapid estimation of the ground motion distribution using the strong ground motion data gathered from the instruments; (2) improvement of the ground motion estimations as earthquake parameters become available and (3) estimation of building damage and casualties based on estimated ground motions and intensities. The present paper elaborates on the ground motion and damage estimation methodologies used by the Istanbul Earthquake Rapid Response System with a special emphasis on validation and verification of the different methods. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, analyses that are conducted can be strongly biased by the standard models employed by seismologists. In response to both of these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework for detecting and clustering seismic signals in continuous seismic records. Our approach combines a deep scattering network and a Gaussian mixture model to cluster seismic signal segments and detect novel structures. To illustrate the power of the framework, we analyze seismic data acquired during the June 2017 Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland landslide. We demonstrate the blind detection and recovery of the repeating precursory seismicity that was recorded before the main landslide rupture, which suggests that our approach could lead to more informative forecasting of the seismic activity in seismogenic areas.},

  abstract = {Red Crater volcano is one of several contemporaneously active vents on the Tongariro Volcanic Centre. Its history provides an opportunity to investigate the contrasting magmatic evolutionary paths of closely-spaced volcanoes. Rocks erupted at Red Crater over the last \textasciitilde{} 3.4 ka display typical subduction-related trace element and isotopic signatures. Those erupted pre-1.8 ka are medium-K andesites (SiO2 \textasciitilde{} 59\textendash 62 wt\%). They represent the most voluminous magmas and were emplaced in 5 lava flow events. An abrupt shift to the eruption of basaltic andesite (SiO2 \textasciitilde{} 53\textendash 54 wt\%) with less radiogenic Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios, occurred post-1.8 ka. This period comprised 6 smaller volume, lava flow episodes and the contemporaneous development of a scoria cone. Plagioclase phenocrysts in post-1.8 ka lava flows have resorbed cores with diverse textural and compositional growth patterns, as would be expected from the disruption of a crystal mush. They are similar to phenocrysts of the pre-1.8 ka lava flows. The post-1.8 ka plagioclase is distinguished from those in the older lavas by overgrowths with elevated An (\textasciitilde{} 70\textendash 90), FeO and MgO contents, that mantle the resorbed cores (\textasciitilde{} An50\textendash 70). These rims are compositionally similar to groundmass plagioclase. This demonstrates that new mafic magma was intruded into the system, mixing with and entraining relic crystals from the older andesite system. Iron and Mg zoning patterns in the crystals are not consistent with significant re-equilibration via diffusion. Hence, the generation of eruptible magma during the last 1.8 ka required repeated mafic intrusion events. The emptying of the older andesitic magma reservoir early in the volcano's history removed buoyancy barriers to the direct eruption of more mafic magmas. This pattern of magmatism is not recorded at the contemporaneously active Ngauruhoe volcano, just 3 km to the SSW. Ngauruhoe rocks are compositionally distinct and are more heterogeneous in isotopic composition. Although mafic recharge is also evident, larger volumes of magma with more radiogenic compositions were erupted and the history of activity extends farther back in time than that of Red Crater. This is consistent with the development of a larger silicic reservoir beneath Ngauruhoe that could have acted as a buoyancy filter preventing direct eruption of mafic magma. The eruptive products of the two volcanoes reveal the diverging development of adjacent magmatic reservoirs that lack lateral connectivity at a scale in the order of 102\textendash 103 m. There is limited literature on the comparative magmatic evolution of closely-spaced conduit/storage systems at arc volcanoes, reflecting the limitations of geochronological data at centennial and millennial timescales. However, such investigations provide insight into andesite assembly and the contrasting volcanism that could be expected in future activity.},

  abstract = {In typical machine learning tasks and applications, it is necessary to obtain or create large labeled datasets in order to to achieve high performance. Unfortunately, large labeled datasets are not always available and can be expensive to source, creating a bottleneck towards more widely applicable machine learning. The paradigm of weak supervision offers an alternative that allows for integration of domain-specific knowledge by enforcing constraints that a correct solution to the learning problem will obey over the output space. In this work, we explore the application of this paradigm to 2-D physical systems governed by non-linear differential equations. We demonstrate that knowledge of the partial differential equations governing a system can be encoded into the loss function of a neural network via an appropriately chosen convolutional kernel. We demonstrate this by showing that the steady-state solution to the 2-D heat equation can be learned directly from initial conditions by a convolutional neural network, in the absence of labeled training data. We also extend recent work in the progressive growing of fully convolutional networks to achieve high accuracy ({$<$} 1.5\% error) at multiple scales of the heat-flow problem, including at the very large scale (1024x1024). Finally, we demonstrate that this method can be used to speed up exact calculation of the solution to the differential equations via finite difference.},

The full set of faults considered in the most recent New Zealand national seismic hazard maps are included in the simulator. New simulator methods are introduced that allow for the inclusion and interaction between upper plate faults and a subduction interface fault below them. The simulator generates sequences of complex slip events and a catalog of finite ruptures hundreds of thousands of years in length. Results from the simulator are evaluated through statistical testing and comparison with geological and geophysical observations. These evaluations include a spatial comparison against historical earthquakes, a comparison against rates of events in the instrumental catalog, and a comparison against scaling relations. Consistency of the model with these measures is generally found, though some differences with productivity is noted, due to incomplete modeling of subducting slab features like geodetically inferred spatially dependent creep and dense faulting in Bay of Plenty faults. Significant emergent aspects of the resulting synthetic catalog are discussed. These include substantial variability over instrumental catalog timescales, clustering of large events in space and time, and spontaneous ruptures that break both the upper crustal faults and subduction interface coseismically. An online repository provides the model output, and an additional site provides python code for reproducing some of the figures in this article and tools for further model output analysis.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a robust method that estimates a reliable earthquake location from only a small number of P-wave arrival times. The method is based on the maximum-likelihood estimation from differential P-wave arrivals. We formulate the problem using a probability density function (PDF) of the residual between observed and predicted differential P-wave travel times between two seismic stations and construct the likelihood function from the sum of the products of the independent PDFs. The hypocenter is determined by an iterative grid-search algorithm that finds the point with the largest probability on successively finer grids. To reduce the effect from outliers possibly concealed within a small number of observations, the Student's t-distribution is used for the PDF of the location likelihood. The jackknife resampling technique is also used to discriminate outliers from the observations. The robustness of the method is tested using the Monte Carlo experiments that locate 10,000 events from small numbers of P-wave arrivals observed within an epicentral distance of 100 km, including both arrival-time error and velocity-model error. The earthquakes are located within an epicentral distance of 8:5 10:8 km and 20:6 33:1 km for events inside the seismic network and outside the network, respectively, using only five P-wave arrivals, including a large arrival-time error between 1 and 5 s. This shows that this method can estimate the location of the event reliably with only a few P-wave arrivals, even when contaminated by an outlier. Therefore, it is believed that this location method could significantly improve the robustness of an earthquake early warning system.}

Volcanic earthquakes and volcanic tremor were both dominated by a frequency of about 2 Hz. Volcanic earthquakes accompanied all phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions, but not small hydrothermal eruptions that originated within Crater Lake. Furthermore, more than half of the M(L) {$>$} 3 volcanic earthquakes and changes in the reduced displacement of 2 Hz volcanic tremor by as much as a factor of 20 occurred without any accompanying eruptive activity. Three and 7 Hz volcanic tremor were also recorded, although never at lower-elevation seismometers. At times, this tremor was stronger at the summit seismometer than the 2 Hz tremor. Their source regions were independent of the 2 Hz source, and located at shallower depths. Volcano-tectonic earthquakes were generally unrelated to eruptive activity. The seismicity accompanying the 1995-1996 eruptive activity was significantly different from that of the period 1971 to 1995, and included volcanic tremor with a frequency of less than 1 Hz, simultaneous changes in the amplitude of the previously independent 2 Hz and 7 Hz volcanic tremor, and finally a change in the frequency content of volcanic earthquakes and volcanic tremor from 2 Hz to wideband. Path transmission effects play an important role in determining the characteristics of seismograms at Ruapehu. The presence of Crater Lake affects both the style of eruptions and the accompanying seismicity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF) in New Zealand is monitored by a network of five telemetered, vertical?component, short?period seismographs. Between 1995 and 2005, 24 earthquakes were located in the Auckland region. Ten of these were located reasonably reliably (position and depth uncertainty {$\leq$}10 km) and all of these were {$<$}15 km deep. Only one of these earthquakes occurred within the AVF. Magnitudes ranged from ML 1.6 to 3.3, and five earthquakes of ML {$\geq$} 2.4 were felt. There were few reliably located earthquakes because most were not recorded by the whole network owing to their relatively low magnitude and a high level of background noise. The Auckland earthquakes are believed to represent normal background seismicity and are not thought to be eruption precursors. All earthquakes were of high?frequency, tectonic type; no low?frequency, volcanic earthquakes were recorded. Based on seismic precursors to eruptions from historically active volcanic fields, we estimate that precursory earthquakes could occur as little as 2 weeks before an Auckland eruption and they could be as large as ML 4.5?5.5. Based on the depth of the background seismicity in Auckland, and previous estimates of the ascent rate and source depth of AVF magmas, we calculate a precursory period as short as a few days. Our best estimate of the length of preeruption seismicity is therefore a few days to a few weeks. The largest precursory earthquakes could be large enough to be felt by most of the population who live in Auckland City. During a magmatic intrusion, deep long?period earthquakes might occur at c. 30 km as magma ascends into the crust. Earthquakes would probably have to be a lot shallower, perhaps only 5 km, before their epicentres might be useful for estimating the location of any eruption. Geodetic monitoring methods (GPS and InSAR) might perform as well as seismic monitoring for identifying unrest, but they have significant limitations. To better monitor and interpret precursory seismicity from the AVF, an increase in the number of seismographs and an improvement in our understanding of the local crustal structure are needed.

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-theart operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

  abstract = {Generalized inversion techniques (GITs) have become popular for determining seismological parameters (e.g., source, attenuation, and site response), particularly in low-to-moderate seismicity regions. Indeed, GITs can potentially provide reliable site-response estimates when a minimum number of recordings is available, as well as valuable information about source parameters and regional attenuation characteristics. Significant advances have been made on GITs in which different approaches and hypotheses were investigated, such as the application of ``nonparametric'' and ``parametric'' inversion schemes. In this context, several scientific questions have arisen that depend on the final scope of the GITs: What is the optimal inversion strategy for a given dataset configuration? What is the impact of the different choices, assumptions, and implementations on the reliability of the results? Is it possible to quantify the associated epistemic uncertainties? Here, we have considered and compared the different approaches of GITs to improve the understanding of each for use in different applications. A methodological benchmark that includes different GIT methods and dataset configurations is set up to fulfill the objective, using a simple synthetic dataset, a French regional sparse dataset, and an Italian national dense dataset. The benchmark is developed in two phases: (1)~phase I: a free phase with no common constraints; and (2)~phase II: a constrained phase with unified reference conditions. Despite unifying the reference conditions in the different inversions, the variability was not reduced. Discrepancies are observed between different terms of GITs. Site responses appear to be the most robust estimates, compared to source and attenuation terms. The way that stress drops of earthquakes and quality factors for crustal attenuation are parameterized appears to lead to significant variability between different approaches. Finally, uncertainties are addressed by quantification of the inter-method variability for the different terms and parameters.},

  abstract = {Kalman filters are often used to estimate the state variables of a dynamic system. However, in the application of Kalman filters some known signal information is often either ignored or dealt with heuristically. For instance, state variable constraints (which may be based on physical considerations) are often neglected because they do not fit easily into the structure of the Kalman filter. This article develops an analytic method of incorporating state variable inequality constraints in the Kalman filter. The resultant filter truncates the probability density function (PDF) of the Kalman filter estimate at the known constraints and then computes the constrained filter estimate as the mean of the truncated PDF. The incorporation of state variable constraints increases the computational effort of the filter but also improves its estimation accuracy. The improvement is demonstrated via simulation results obtained from a turbofan engine model. It is also shown that the truncated Kalman filter may provide a more accurate way of incorporating inequality constraints than other constrained filters (e.g. the projection approach to constrained filtering).},

  abstract = {The Kalman filter is the minimum-variance state estimator for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise. Even if the noise is non-Gaussian, the Kalman filter is the best linear estimator. For nonlinear systems it is not possible, in general, to derive the optimal state estimator in closed form, but various modifications of the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the state. These modifications include the extended Kalman filter, the unscented Kalman filter, and the particle filter. Although the Kalman filter and its modifications are powerful tools for state estimation, we might have information about a system that the Kalman filter does not incorporate. For example, we may know that the states satisfy equality or inequality constraints. In this case we can modify the Kalman filter to exploit this additional information and get better filtering performance than the Kalman filter provides. This paper provides an overview of various ways to incorporate state constraints in the Kalman filter and its nonlinear modifications. If both the system and state constraints are linear, then all of these different approaches result in the same state estimate, which is the optimal constrained linear state estimate. If either the system or constraints are nonlinear, then constrained filtering is, in general, not optimal, and different approaches give different results.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

  abstract = {Nested sampling estimates directly how the likelihood function relates to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the ``nested'' contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

  abstract = {Coda waves are sensitive to changes in the subsurface because the strong scattering that generates these waves causes them to repeatedly sample a limited region of space. Coda wave interferometry is a technique that exploits this sensitivity to estimate slight changes in the medium from a comparison of the coda waves before and after the perturbation. For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location. \textcopyright{} Birkh\"auser Verlag, Basel, 2006.},

  abstract = {Rayleigh wave data obtained from Columbia long-period seismographs installed during the International Geophysical Year (I.G.Y.) at Honolulu, Hawaii; Suva, Fiji; and Mt. Tsukuba, Japan, are analyzed to determine group and phase velocities in the Pacific for the period range 20 to 140 seconds. Group velocities are determined by usual techniques (Ewing and Press, 1952, p. 377). Phase velocities are determined by assuming the initial phase to be independent of period and choosing the initial phase so that the phase velocity curve agrees in the long period range with the phase velocity curve of the mantle Rayleigh wave given by Brune (1961). Correlations of wave trains between the stations Honolulu and Mt. Tsukuba are used to obtain phase velocity values independent of initial phase. The group velocity rises from 3.5 km/sec at a period of about 20 see to a maximum of 4.0 km/sec at a period of about 40 sec and then decreases to 3.65 km/sec at a period of about 140 sec. Phase velocity is nearly constant in the period range 30-75 sec with a value slightly greater than 4.0 km/sec. Most of the phase velocity curves indicate a maximum and a minimum at periods of approximately 30 and 50 sec respectively. At longer periods the phase velocities increase to 4.18 km/sec at a period of 120 sec. Except across the Melanesian-New Zealand region, dispersion curves for paths of Rayleigh waves throughout the Pacific basin proper are rather uniform and agree fairly well with theoretical dispersion curves for models with a normal oceanic crust and a low velocity channel. Both phase and group velocities are comparatively lower for the paths of Rayleigh waves across the Melanesian-New Zealand region, suggesting a thicker crustal layer and/or lower crustal velocities in this region.}

The relation between log S and log Mo is remarkably linear (slope {$\sim$} 2/3) indicating a constant stress drop {$\Delta\sigma$}; {$\Delta\sigma$} = 30, 100 and 60 bars are obtained for inter-plate, intra-plate and ``average'' earthquakes, respectively. Except for very large earthquakes, the relation MS {$\sim$} (2/3) log Mo {$\sim$} 2 log L is established by the data. This is consistent with the dynamic dislocation model for point dislocation rise times and rupture times of most earthquakes. For very large earthquakes MS {$\sim$} (1/3) log Mo {$\sim$} log L {$\sim$} (1/3) log ES. For very small earthquakes MS {$\sim$} log Mo {$\sim$} 3 log L {$\sim$} log ES. Scaling rules are assumed and justified. This model predicts log ES {$\sim$} 1.5 MS {$\sim$} 3 log L which is consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Since the static energy is proportional to {$\overline{\sigma}$}L3, where {$\overline{\sigma}$} is the average stress, this relation suggests a constant apparent stress {$\eta\overline{\sigma}$} where {$\eta$} is the efficiency. The earthquake data suggest {$\eta\overline{\sigma}\sptilde$}0.5 {$\Delta\sigma$}. These relations lead to log S {$\sim$} MS consistent with the empirical relation. This relation together with a simple geometrical argument explains the magnitude-frequency relation log N {$\sim$} - MS.},

The observations show that during windy intervals and in the period range 20\textendash 100 s there is a strong correlation between local atmospheric pressure changes and the noise recorded by a vertical seismograph located on the surface. In contrast, over the same range of periods there is no correlation between the seismic noise recorded in the mine and local atmospheric pressure changes except during the passage of acoustic waves. It is shown that the noise in this pass band is not due to the buoyant response of the seismograph, but is caused by the motion of the Earth responding to atmospheric pressure changes.},

  abstract = {We utilize seismic converted phases on more than 700 receiver functions calculated for 42 stations in the South Island, New Zealand, to infer crustal and uppermost mantle structure. We determine the crustal thickness from direct observations of conversion from the Moho interface and infer zone of the maximum thickness being located along the axis of the Southern Alps, just east from the Alpine fault. The crustal root widens from north to south in the direction perpendicular to the Alpine fault and appears to have an asymmetric structure. Stations in the alpine portion of island show evidence for prominent midcrustal conversions. Significant crustal thickening is developed in response to both the convergent component of the motion on the Alpine fault and subduction in the Fiordland region. We propose two models for a strong uppermost mantle conversion that occurs at depths between 33 and 83 km on 16 stations and forms a large continuous feature along the east coast and in the central portions of the South Island. Our preferred model attributes upper mantle conversion to tectonically underplated oceanic crust formed by late Oligocene-Miocene spreading between the Australian and Pacific plates, which was detached from the Australian plate and tectonically underplated under the South Island. An alternative model attributes the upper mantle conversions to long-lived seismic fabric created by subduction of the Gondwanaland margin. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.}

We find no evidence that higher fees or lower managerial ownership are associated with lower net-of-fee performance. Nevertheless, compensation rises and shifts to performance-insensitive components during fundraising booms. Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund managers. Our evidence suggests that managers with higher fees deliver higher gross performance, and highlights that agency costs are an inevitable consequence of the information frictions endemic to agency relationships.}

Such systems aim to provide short (seconds to tens of seconds) warnings of impending disaster, enabling the first risk mitigation and damage control steps to be taken. This study presents the feasibility of a large scale cross-border regional system for Central Asian countries. Genetic algorithms are used to design efficient EEW networks, computing optimal station locations and trigger thresholds in recorded ground acceleration. Installation of such systems within 3 years aims to both reducing the endemic lack of strong motion data in Central Asia that is limiting the possibility of improving seismic hazard assessment, and at providing the first regional earthquake early warning system in the area.},

Recently, a global Eulerian model was included as a module of the HYSPLIT modeling system. Back-trajectory calculations have been one of the most attractive and prominent features by which HYSPLIT has been used in many studies. However, coupling the back-trajectory calculation with a Lagrangian dispersion component can produce a more realistic depiction of the link between the concentrations at the receptor and the sources influencing it.},

  abstract = {A region of low seismic-wave speed is detected beneath the central Southern Alps of New Zealand on the basis of traveltime delays for both wide-angle reflections and P-waves from teleseismic events. Respective ray paths for these P-waves are mutually perpendicular, ruling out anisotropy as a cause of the delays. The low-speed region measures about 25 km by 40 km, has a speed reduction of 6\{percnt\}-10\{percnt\}, and is largely above the downward projection of the Alpine fault. The most likely cause of the low-speed zone is high fluid pressure due to excess water being released by prograde and strain-induced metamorphism into the lower crust. Because enhanced fluid pressure reduces the work required for deformation, the existence of the central Southern Alps low-speed zone implies that this part of the Australian-Pacific plate boundary is relatively weak.}

Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) relate ground-motion intensity measures to variables describing earthquake source, path, and site effects. We select from many available GMPEs those models recommended for use in seismic hazard assessments in the Global Earthquake Model. We present a GMPE selection procedure that evaluates multi-dimensional ground motion trends (e.g., with respect to magnitude, distance and structural period), examines functional forms, and evaluates published quantitative tests of GMPE performance against independent data. Our recommendations include: four models, based principally on simulations, for stable continental regions (SCRs); three empirical models for interface and in-slab subduction zone (SZ) events; and three empirical models for active shallow crustal regions (ACRs). To approximately incorporate epistemic uncertainties, the selection process accounts for alternate representations of key GMPE attributes, such as the rate of distance attenuation, which are defensible from available data. Recommended models for each domain will change over time as additional GMPEs are developed.}

The new NSHM supersedes the earlier NSHM published in 2002 and used as the hazard basis for the New Zealand Loadings Standard and numerous other end-user applications. The new NSHM incorporates a fault source model that has been updated with over 200 new onshore and offshore fault sources and utilizes new New Zealand-based and international scaling relationships for the parameterization of the faults. The distributed seismicity model has also been updated to include post-1997 seismicity data, a new seismicity regionalization, and improved methodology for calculation of the seismicity parameters. Probabilistic seismic hazard maps produced from the new NSHM show a similar pattern of hazard to the earlier model at the national scale, but there are some significant reductions and increases in hazard at the regional scale. The national-scale differences between the new and earlier NSHM appear less than those seen between much earlier national models, indicating that some degree of consistency has been achieved in the national-scale pattern of hazard estimates, at least for return periods of 475~years and greater.Online Material: Table of fault source parameters for the 2010 national seismic-hazard model.},

We also outline key activities that will develop the model components, define procedures for periodic update of the model, and effectively articulate the model to end-users and stakeholders. The development of a National Volcanic Hazard Model is a formidable task that will require long-term stability in terms of team effort, collaboration, and resources. Development of the model in stages or editions that are modular will make the process a manageable one that progressively incorporates additional volcanic hazards over time, and additional functionalities (e.g., short-term forecasting). The first edition is likely to be limited to updating and incorporating existing ashfall hazard models, with the other hazards associated with lahar, pyroclastic density currents, lava flow, ballistics, debris avalanche, and gases/aerosols being considered in subsequent updates.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the state estimation problem of nonlinear non-Gaussian systems with state subject to a nonlinear inequality constraint. Taking into account the available additional information about the state given by the constraint increases the estimate quality compared to classical state estimation methods which cannot utilize the information. Considering the constraint in the form of an inequality involving a nonlinear function of the state makes the state estimation problem difficult and hence treated only marginally. In this paper, a generic local filter for the inequality constrained estimation problem is proposed. It covers the extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and divided difference filter as special cases and enforces the constraint by truncating the conditional density of the state. The truncation is computationally cheap, yet it provides high estimate quality of the constrained estimate. The same idea is then utilized in a truncation Gaussian mixture filter which is also proposed in the paper to increase the estimate quality further by providing a global constrained estimate. Superior estimate quality and computational efficiency of the proposed filters are illustrated in two numerical examples. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Near vertical and wide-angle seismic data provide evidence for a gradational crust-mantle boundary in a depth range of 15-20 km beneath the Central Volcanic Region (CVR), New Zealand. This volcanic area includes the Taupo Volcanic Zone and is a direct extension of Tonga-Kermadec oceanic backarc spreading into continental lithosphere. Long-range seismic refraction data show velocities of 6 km s-1 and less within the top 15 km of the crust of the CVR. At a depth of 15 km compressional seismic velocities increase to 6.8 km s-1, and then to 7.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 km s-1 at {$\sim$}20 km depth. These 7.4 km s-1 seismic wave speeds are interpreted as anomalous upper mantle as beneath this level passive seismic studies show similar Pn wave speeds that increase slowly to {$\sim$}7.8 km s-1 at about 80 km deep. We interpret rocks between 15 and 20 km to be a layer of new crust formed by underplating. The strongest reflection observed, and what might also be interpreted as a reflection Moho, is from the top of the proposed underplated layer at 15 km depth. At 20 km depth no such distinct reflection is observed. Rather, wide-angle reflection data show a continuum of low-level reflectivity between 15 and at least 35 km depth, indicating some heterogeneity and/ or structure within the lower crust and upper mantle. Thus the transition from lower crust to upper mantle is broad, and a conventional reflection Moho does not exist beneath the CVR. Buoyancy force calculations based on rock uplift for the central North Island indicate that the subjacent mantle, to a depth of 80-100 km is {$\sim$}70 kg m-3 or 2 per cent less dense than normal mantle. Best estimates attribute half of this density anomaly to the effects of increased temperature with additional contributions from partial melt ({$\sim$}1.2 per cent) and melt residuum. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2006 RAS.},

  abstract = {Loess high banks along the right side of the Danube in Hungary are potential subjects of landslides. Small scale ambient seismic noise tomography was used at the Dunaszekcs\H{o} high bank. The aim of the study was to map near surface velocity anomalies since we assume that the formation of tension cracks\textemdash which precede landslides\textemdash are represented by low velocities. Mapping Rayleigh wave group velocity distribution can help to image intact and creviced areas and identify the most vulnerable sections. The study area lies at the top of the Castle Hill of Dunaszekcs\H{o}, which was named after Castellum Lugio, a fortress of Roman origin. The presently active head scarp was formed in April 2011, and our study area was chosen to be at its surroundings. Cross-correlation functions of ambient noise recordings were used to retrieve the dispersion curves, which served as the input of the group velocity tomography. Phase cross-correlation and time-frequency phase weighted stacking was applied to calculate the cross-correlation functions. The average Rayleigh wave group velocity at the loess high bank was found to be 171 ms- 1. The group velocity map at a 0.1~s period revealed a low-velocity region, whose location coincides with a highly creviced area, where slope failure takes place along a several meter wide territory. Another low velocity region was found, which might indicate a previously unknown loosened domain. The highest velocities were observed at the supposed remnants of Castellum Lugio.},

We calculate cross correlation functions (CCFs) of ambient noises recorded by four seismic stations on the active volcano from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015 at 0.5\textendash 1~Hz, 1\textendash 2~Hz, and 2\textendash 4~Hz. Applying moving time windows to calculate cross spectrum between daily CCFs and reference CCF, which is the average for the all observation period, we compute daily velocity changes. The obtained velocity changes vary from -1\% to 3\% with a dominant period of about 1~year. We calculate areal strains by using Global Navigation Satellite Systems data at the volcano. It is evident that the velocity changes are well correlated with the areal strain changes whose linear trend is removed. The stress sensitivity of velocity changes, which are obtained from the observed velocity changes and areal strains, is lower at 0.5\textendash 1~Hz than that at higher frequencies: (7.1~{$\pm~$}1.3)~\texttimes ~10-8~Pa-1 at 0.5\textendash 1~Hz, (1.4~{$\pm~$}0.1)~\texttimes ~10-7~Pa-1 at 1\textendash 2~Hz, and (1.3~{$\pm~$}0.1)~\texttimes ~10-7~Pa-1 at 2\textendash 4~Hz. Modeling the velocity changes of Rayleigh wave propagating in layered structures, we find that the observed velocity changes are concentrated in the upper 1~km of the structure. Since similar frequency dependency is recognized among the stress sensitivity of velocity changes reported in previous studies, we conclude that the velocity changes are localized in the shallow depth because of the increase of confining pressure.},

It requires only normal data for training and works well when anomalous data are rare. The model features an ensemble of random HS-Trees, and the tree structure is constructed without any data. This makes the method highly efficient because it requires no model restructuring when adapting to evolving data streams. Our analysis shows that Streaming HS-Trees has constant amortised time complexity and constant memory requirement. When compared with a state-of-the-art method, our method performs favourably in terms of detection accuracy and runtime performance. Our experimental results also show that the detection performance of Streaming HS-Trees is not sensitive to its parameter settings.},

Here, we explore how we can automate the detection of such dynamically triggered earthquakes using a simple, diagnostic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold as well as a convolutional deep metric learning network. Our analysis shows that the deep learning network was more reliable at detecting small earthquakes than the SNR method.},

Depth resolution kernels indicate that this approach can recover near-surface shear-modulus structure in the upper 50\textendash 100~m of the Earth. Our estimate for Vs30 at the closest station (BPH01) agrees with an independent result by Yong et~al. which was based on an active source survey with a geophone array. Vs30 derived from the borehole S-wave speed model by Fletcher et~al. also agrees with estimates at nearby locations, considering the size of uncertainties. Derived structures are much smoother than their models, however. This is because our method analyses slow quasi-static deformation of the solid Earth in the frequency range 0.005\textendash 0.05~Hz that inherently limits depth resolution. Lack of detailed variations in structures does not seem to be the problem for estimating Vs30 as Vs30 is an averaged quantity from the upper 30~m of the Earth. Also our estimates are not affected by different choices of frequency range in the inversion. However, our method may have some difficulty at stiff, hard-rock sites because ground deformation caused by surface pressure can become small and the key observables in our method, the ratios between seismic amplitude and surface pressure change, become difficult to measure accurately.},

  abstract = {Colocated seismic and pressure data are available at many seismic stations in the world. For frequencies approximately between 0.01 and 0.05 Hz, colocated data show evidence of strong coupling between the atmosphere and the solid Earth, especially when pressure is high. Coherence between vertical seismic data and pressure is often higher than 0.9. Such data provide information for shallow structure in the upper 50\textendash 100 m because they show how the Earth responds to surface pressure changes. We present the basic theory and an inversion scheme for shallow structure using surface observables {$\eta$}(f)=Sz/Sp where f is frequency and Sz and Sp are the power spectral densities of vertical seismic data and of surface pressure data. A vertically heterogeneous medium is assumed beneath a station where density, P wave velocity, and S wave velocity change with depth. We show that the integration of the minors for the equations of motion gives a fast algorithm to compute {$\eta$}(f). Using numerical differentiation, we derive depth sensitivity kernels for {$\eta$}(f) with which we invert {$\eta$}(f) for shallow structure, just like we invert phase velocity of surface waves for the Earth structure. Depth sensitivity kernels show that if we take density, bulk modulus, and rigidity as independent parameters, {$\eta$}(f) has no sensitivity to density structure, making it mainly a function of two elastic constants. We present examples of inversion based on this formulation.},

  abstract = {We iteratively improve a 3-D tomographic model of the southern California crust using numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation based on a spectral-element method (SEM) in combination with an adjoint method. The initial 3-D model is provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The data set comprises three-component seismic waveforms (i.e. both body and surface waves), filtered over the period range 2-30 s, from 143 local earthquakes recorded by a network of 203 stations. Time windows for measurements are automatically selected by the FLEXWIN algorithm. The misfit function in the tomographic inversion is based on frequency-dependent multitaper traveltime differences. The gradient of the misfit function and related finite-frequency sensitivity kernels for each earthquake are computed using an adjoint technique. The kernels are combined using a source subspace projection method to compute a model update at each iteration of a gradient-based minimization algorithm. The inversion involved 16 iterations, which required 6800 wavefield simulations. The new crustal model, m16, is described in terms of independent shear (VS) and bulk-sound (VB) wave speed variations. It exhibits strong heterogeneity, including local changes of {$\pm$}30 per cent with respect to the initial 3-D model. The model reveals several features that relate to geological observations, such as sedimentary basins, exhumed batholiths, and contrasting lithologies across faults. The quality of the new model is validated by quantifying waveform misfits of full-length seismograms from 91 earthquakes that were not used in the tomographic inversion. The new model provides more accurate synthetic seismograms that will benefit seismic hazard assessment. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2009 RAS.},

The ultrasonic propagation in cancellous bone is modeled using the Biot theory modified by the Johnson et al. model for viscous exchange between fluid and structure. The sensitivity of the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame is studied showing their effect on the fast and slow wave forms. The inverse problem is solved numerically by the least squares method. Five parameters are inverted: the porosity, tortuosity, viscous characteristic length, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame. The minimization of the discrepancy between experiment and theory is made in the time domain. The inverse problem is shown to be well posed, and its solution to be unique. Experimental results for slow and fast waves transmitted through human cancellous bone samples are given and compared with theoretical predictions.},

In order to permit the incorporation of any a priori information about parameters and any distribution of data (not only of gaussian type) we propose to formulate the problem not using single quantities (such as bounds, means, etc.) but using probability density functions for data and parameters. We also want our formulation to allow for the incorporation of theoretical errors, i.e. non-exact theoretical relationships between data and parameters (due to discretization, or incomplete theoretical knowledge); to do that in a natural way we propose to define general theoretical relationships also as probability density functions. We show then that the inverse problem may be formulated as a problem of combination of information: the experimental information about data, the a priori information about parameters, and the theoretical information. With this approach, the general solution of the non-linear inverse problem is unique and consistent (solving the same problem, with the same data, but with a different system of parameters does not change the solution).},

Approximate solutions to this problem are reviewed and compared with new algorithms. All the algorithms investigated are based on the unscented Kalman filter. Two illustrative examples of chemical processes are discussed. Numerical results suggest that the use of constrained unscented filtering algorithms improves the accuracy of the state estimates compared to the unconstrained unscented filter, especially when a poor initialization is set. Moreover, it is shown that the constrained filters that enforce the state interval constraint on both the state estimate and error covariance yield more accurate state estimates than the methods that enforce such constraint only on the state estimates. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

From July 2006 onwards, infrared (IR) thermometry has been used with this system, enabling more accurate measurements of lake volume and temperature based on simple and intensive observations than has been possible in any other previous studies. The heat discharge remained largely constant at approximately 220 MW, with the exception of an abrupt increase to 280 MW that coincided with a rapid decrease in the water level in August 2007. Simultaneously, an increase in temperature at a shallow depth was suggested by other observations. The crater lake was found to respond to even slight changes in volcanic fluid supply, which can be well quantified by our method. Thus, a crater lake can be monitored more precisely than subaerial fumaroles whose energy estimation is often accompanied by large uncertainties. Our monitoring technique of a crater lake provides information on the subsurface hydrothermal system beneath it, for which any in-situ measurements are practically impossible.},

  abstract = {The first crater of Nakadake, peak of Aso volcano, Japan, contains a hot water lake that shows interesting variations in water level and temperature. These variations were discovered by precise, continuous observations of the lake independent of precipitation. We developed a numerical model of a hot crater lake and compared with observational data for the period from July 2006 to January 2009. The numerical model revealed seasonal changes in mass flux (75\textendash 132~kg/s) and enthalpy (1,840\textendash 3,030~kJ/kg) for the fluid supplied to the lake. The relation between the enthalpy and mass flux indicates that the bottom input fluid is a mixture of high- and low-temperature fluids. Assuming a mixture of high-temperature steam at 800\textdegree C and liquid water at 100\textdegree C, we evaluated the liquid and steam fluxes. The liquid water flux shows a seasonal increase lagging behind the rainy season by 2~months, suggesting that the liquid water is predominantly groundwater. The fluctuation pattern in the flux of the high-temperature steam shows a relation with the amplitude of volcanic tremor, suggesting that heating of the hydrothermal system drives the tremor. Consequently, precise observations of a hot crater lake represent a potential method of monitoring volcanic hydrothermal systems in the shallow parts of the volcanoes.},

  abstract = {Volcanic hazard maps depict areas that may be affected by dangerous volcanic processes, such as pyroclastic density currents, lava flows, lahars, and tephra fall. These visualisations of volcanic hazard information are used to communicate with a wide variety of audiences both during times of dormancy and volcanic crisis. Although most volcanic hazard maps show similar types of content, such as hazard footprints or zones, they vary greatly in communication style, appearance, and visual design. For example, maps for different volcanoes will use different combinations of graphics, symbols, colours, base maps, legends, and text. While this variety is a natural reflection of the diverse social, cultural, political, and volcanic settings in which the maps are created, crises and past work suggest that such visual design choices can potentially play an important role in volcanic crisis communication by influencing how people understand the hazard map and use it to make decisions. Map reading is a complex process, in which people construct meaning by interpreting the various visual representations within the context of their information needs, goals, knowledge, and experience. Visual design of the map and the characteristics of the hazard map audience can therefore influence how hazard maps are understood and applied. Here, we review case studies of volcanic crises and interdisciplinary research that addresses the relationship between hazard maps, visual design, and communication. Overall, this growing body of work suggests that volcanic hazard maps can be very useful visual tools for crisis communication if they are designed in a way that provides clear and useful information for the audience. Further, while it is important that each map is designed for its unique situation and setting, engaging with hazard map audiences to better understand their information needs and considering lessons learnt from interdisciplinary work on visual communication can help inform and guide knowledge exchange using maps.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis is becoming an increasingly popular component of volcanic risk reduction strategies worldwide. While probabilistic hazard analyses offer many advantages for decision-making, displaying the statistical results of these analyses on a map presents new hazard communication challenges. Probabilistic information is complex, difficult to interpret, and associated with uncertainties. Conveying such complicated data on a static map image without careful consideration of user perspectives or context, may result in contrasting interpretations, misunderstandings, or aversion to using the map. Here, we present the results of interviews and surveys conducted with organisational stakeholders and scientists in New Zealand which explored how probabilistic volcanic hazard map properties influence map interpretation, understanding, and preference. Our results suggest that data classification, colour scheme, content, and key expression play important roles in how users engage with and interpret probabilistic volcanic hazard maps. Data classification was found to influence the participants' perceived uncertainty and data reading accuracy, with isarithmic style maps reducing uncertainty and increasing accuracy best. Colour scheme had a strong influence on the type of hazard messages interpreted, with a red-yellow scheme conveying the message of a hazard distribution (high to low), and a red-yellow-blue scheme conveying the message of hazard state (present or absent) and/or risk. Multiple types of map content were found to be useful, and hazard curves were viewed as valuable supplements. The concept of ``confidence'' was more easily interpreted than upper and lower percentiles when expressing uncertainty on the hazard curves. Numerical and verbal expression in the key also had an influence on interpretation, with a combination of both a percent (e.g., 25\%) and a natural frequency (e.g., 1 in 4) ``probability'' being the most inclusive and widely-understood expression. The importance of these map property choices was underscored by a high portion of participants preferring to receive maps in unalterable formats, such as PDF. This study illustrates how engaging with users in a bottom-up approach can complement and enhance top-down approaches to volcanic hazard mapping through a collaborative and integrative design process which may help to prevent miscommunications in a future crisis when maps are likely to be drafted and disseminated rapidly.},

  abstract = {The definition of a suite of analogue volcanoes, or volcanoes that are considered to share enough characteristics as to be considered exchangeable to a certain extent, is becoming a key component of volcanic hazard assessment. This is particularly the case for volcanoes where data are lacking or scarce. Moreover, volcano comparisons have often been based on similarities and differences inferred through expert judgement and not necessarily informed by volcano characteristics from global datasets. These similarities can be based on a range of features, from very simplified (e.g. statrovolcanoes) to very specific (e.g. detailed eruption chronologies), and may be strongly influenced by the personal experience of individuals or teams conducting the analogue analysis. In this work, we present VOLCANS (VOLCano ANalogues Search)\textemdash an objective, structured and reproducible method to identify sets of analogue volcanoes from global volcanological databases. Five overarching criteria (tectonic setting, rock geochemistry, volcano morphology, eruption size and eruption style), and a structured combination of them, are used to quantify overall multi-criteria volcano analogy. This innovative method is complementary to expert-derived sets of analogue volcanoes and provides the user with full flexibility to weigh the criteria and identify analogue volcanoes applicable to varied purposes. Some results are illustrated for three volcanoes with diverse features and significant recent and/or ongoing eruptions: K{\=\i}lauea (USA), Fuego (Guatemala) and Sinabung (Indonesia). The identified analogue volcanoes correspond well with a priori analogue volcanoes derived from expert knowledge. In some cases, single-criterion searches may not be able to isolate a reduced set of analogue volcanoes but any multi-criteria search can provide high degrees of granularity in the sets of analogue volcanoes obtained. Data quality and quantity can be important factors, especially for single-criterion searches and volcanoes with very scarce data (e.g. Sinabung). Nevertheless, the method gives stable results overall across multi-criteria searches of analogue volcanoes. Potential uses of VOLCANS range from quantitative volcanic hazard assessment to promoting fundamental understanding of volcanic processes.},

A representative data set containing volcano-tectonic earthquakes, long-period events, volcanic tremors, and hybrid events was used to train these models. Experimental results show that RNN, LSTM, and GRU can exploit temporal and frequency information from continuous seismic data, attaining close to 90\%, 94\%, and 92\% events correctly detected and classified. A second experiment is presented in this paper. The architectures described above, trained with data from campaigns of seismic records obtained in 1995-2002, have been tested with data from the recent seismic survey performed at the Deception Island Volcano in 2016-2017 by the Spanish Antarctic scientific campaign. Despite the variations in the geophysical properties of the seismic events within the volcano across eruptive periods, results provide good generalization accuracy. This result expands the possibilities of RNNs for real-time monitoring of volcanic activity, even if seismic sources change over time.},

In this study, a series of procedures to improve the accuracy of the WRF-FALL3D model for the case of the eruption of Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane in 2018 are proposed, which were verified through field surveys of ash deposits, showing that the accuracy of the model can be improved by selecting a range of column heights and promptly conducting field surveys following an event. Also, a methodology to estimate the amount of work necessary to clear road networks and river channels is proposed, which was applied to a volcanic event similar to that of the Hoei eruption of Mt. Fuji in 1707. The results also emphasize the need to improve the estimation of column heights in the future, which is of paramount importance to ensure the safety and operational continuity of human infrastructure in the vicinity of major active volcanoes.},

  abstract = {[1] A log-based volcanic stratigraphy of Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1256D provides a vertical cross- section view of in situ upper crust formed at the East Pacific Rise (EPR) with unprecedented resolution. This stratigraphy model comprises ten electrofacies, principally identified from formation microscanner images. In this study, we build a lava flow stratigraphy model for the extrusive section in Hole 1256D by correlating these electrofacies with observations of flow types from the modern EPR, such as sheet flows and breccias, and pillow lavas and their distribution. The resulting flow stratigraphy model for the Hole 1256D extrusive section represents the first realization of detailed in situ EPR upper oceanic crust construction processes that have been detected only indirectly from remote geophysical data. We correlated the flow stratigraphy model with surface geology observed from the southern EPR (14\textdegree S) by Shinkai 6500 dives in order to obtain the relationship between lava flow types and ridge axis-ridge slope morphology. This dive information was also used to give a spatial-time reference frame for modeling lava deposition history in Hole 1256D. In recon-structing the lava deposition history, we interpreted that the origins of the {$\sim$}100 m thick intervals with abun-dant pillow lavas in Hole 1256D are within the axial slope where pillow lavas were observed during the Shinkai 6500 dives and previous EPR surveys. This correlation could constrain the lava deposition history in Hole 1256D crust. Using the lateral scale of ridge axis\textendash ridge slope topography from the Shinkai 6500 observations and assuming the paleospreading rate was constant, 50\% of the extrusive rocks in Hole 1256D crust were formed within {$\sim$}2000 m of the ridge axis, whereas nearly all of the remaining extrusive section was formed within {$\sim$}3000 m of the ridge axis. These results are consistent with the upper crustal construction model previously suggested by seismic studies.},

New capabilities of this implementation include the ability to calculate hazard curves which describe the distribution of the exceedance probability as a function of intensity (e.g., tephra load) on a grid of points covering the target area. The computed hazard curves are (i) absolute (accounting for the probability of eruption in a given time frame, and for all the possible vent locations and eruptive sizes) and (ii) Bayesian (computed at different percentiles, in order to quantify the epistemic uncertainty). Such curves allow representation of the full information contained in the probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment (PVHA) and are well suited to become a main input to quantitative risk analyses.PyBetVH allows for interactive visualization of both the computed hazard curves, and the corresponding Bayesian hazard/probability maps. PyBetVH is designed to minimize the efforts of end users, making PVHA results accessible to people who may be less experienced in probabilistic methodologies, e.g. decision makers. The broad compatibility of Python language has also allowed PyBetVH to be installed on the VHub cyber-infrastructure, where it can be run online or downloaded at no cost. PyBetVH can be used to assess any type of magmatic hazard from any volcano. Here we illustrate how to perform a PVHA through PyBetVH using the example of analyzing tephra fallout from the Okataina Volcanic Centre (OVC), New Zealand, and highlight the range of outputs that the tool can generate.},

  abstract = {Transient volcanic plumes, having similar eruption duration and rise timescales, characterize many unsteady Strombolian to Vulcanian eruptions. Despite being more common, such plumes are less studied than their steady state counterpart from stronger eruptions. Here we investigate the initial dynamics of transient volcanic plumes using high-speed (visible light and thermal) and high-resolution (visible light) videos from Strombolian to Vulcanian eruptions of Stromboli (Italy), Fuego (Guatemala), and Sakurajima (Japan) volcanoes. Physical parameterization of the plumes has been performed by defining their front velocity, velocity field, volume, and apparent surface temperature. We also characterized the ejection of the gas-pyroclast mixture at the vent, in terms of number, location, duration, and frequency of individual ejection pulses and of time-resolved mass eruption rate of the ejecta's ash fraction. Front velocity evolves along two distinct trends related to the initial gas-thrust phase and later buoyant phase. Plumes' velocity field, obtained via optical flow analysis, highlights different features, including initial jets and the formation and/or merging of ring vortexes at different scales. Plume volume increases over time following a power law trend common to all volcanoes and affected by discharge history at the vent. Time-resolved ash eruption rates range between 102 and 107 kg/s and may vary up to 2 orders of magnitude within the first seconds of eruption. Our results help detailing how the number, location, angle, duration, velocity, and time interval between ejection pulses at the vents crucially control the initial (first tens of second), and possibly later, evolution of transient volcanic plumes.},

  abstract = {This thesis addresses the state of stress in continental lithosphere, the mechanisms by which it is maintained, and its implications for the mechanical behavior of plate-bounding faults and the accommodation of tectonic deformation. Measured stress magnitudes in intraplate brittle crust are consistent with the Coulomb frictional-failure criterion and coefficients of friction similar to those determined in labo- ratory experiments, implying that the upper crust is in a state of frictional equilibrium. If the lower portions of the lithosphere deform ductilely, then the lithosphere as a whole is in a state of failure and its strength must equal the magnitude of any applied tectonic forces. We use this inference to consider the vertical distribution of lithospheric strength and the bounds this places on intraplate strain rates. Using earthquake focal be controlled by relatively far-field processes. Finally, by amalgamating data from three independent seismographic networks, we have produced an improved Japanese focal mechanism catalog with which to investigate the stresses associated with subduction and crustal collision. The axis of maximum hori- zontal compressive stress in central and southwestern Japan is found to be approximately parallel to the axis of maximum contractional strain rate once deformation associated with an elastic model of subduction thrust locking has been subtracted from the original strain mechanism stress inversions, we have mapped the horizontal stress field in central and southern California and verified previous suggestions that the San Andreas fault (SAF) slips in response to lower levels of shear stress than anticipated on the basis of the intraplate or laboratory observations. By comparing the stress results with geodetic data and dynamic modeling results, we further show that while crustal velocities adjacent to the SAF are consistent with localized plate kinematics, crustal stresses seem to rate observations. This suggests that the state of stress in the Japanese arc is related more to long-term relative plate motions than to interseismic strain accumulation and seismogenic release on the subduction thrusts.}

The Alpine Fault produces M{$<$}inf{$>$}W{$<$}/inf{$>\sim$}8 earthquakes every 200-400 years and last ruptured in 1717 AD. Wireline geophysical logs and rock cores extending from one side of the Alpine Fault to the other were acquired in two boreholes drilled in 2011 at Gaunt Creek during the first phase of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP-1). These data document ambient conditions under which the next Alpine Fault earthquake will occur. Principal component analysis of the wireline logging data reveals that {$>$}80\% of the variance is accounted for by electrical, acoustic, and natural gamma properties, and preliminary multivariate classification enables the lithologies of sections of missing core to be reconstructed from geophysical measurements. The fault zone exhibits systematic variations in properties consistent with common processes of progressive alteration and comminution near the principal slip zone, superimposed on different protolith compositions. Our observations imply that the fault zone has the opposite sense of elastic asymmetry at 0.1-100 m scales to that of the crustal-scale orogen imaged by remote geophysical methods. On the basis of the fault-zone scale asymmetry, the bimaterial interface model of preferred earthquake rupture directions implies a northeastward direction of preferred Alpine Fault rupture. On-going characterization of the structural and hydraulic architecture of the Alpine Fault will improve our understanding of the relationship between in situ conditions, earthquake rupture processes, and the hazards posed by future earthquakes. \textcopyright{} 2013.

  abstract = {The scaling of rupture properties with magnitude is of critical importance to earthquake early warning systems that rely on source characterization using limited snapshots of waveform data. ShakeAlert, a prototype earthquake early warning system that is being developed for the western United States, provides real-time estimates of earthquake magnitude based on P wave peak ground displacements measured at stations triggered by the event. The algorithms used in ShakeAlert assume that the displacement measurements at each station are statistically independent and that there exists a linear and time-independent relation between log peak ground displacement and earthquake magnitude. Here we challenge this basic assumption using the largest data set assembled for this purpose to date: a comprehensive database of more than 140,000 vertical-component waveforms from M4.5 to M9 earthquakes occurring near Japan from 1997 through 2018 and recorded by the K-NET and KiK-net strong-motion networks. By analyzing the time evolution of P wave peak ground displacements for these earthquakes, we show that there is a break, or saturation, in the magnitude-displacement scaling that depends on the length of the measurement time window. We demonstrate that the magnitude at which this saturation occurs is well-explained by a simple and nondeterministic model of earthquake rupture growth. We then use the predictions of this saturation model to develop a Bayesian framework for estimating posterior uncertainties in real-time magnitude estimates.},

This paper concentrates on the opening phases of an eruption episode which occurred approximately 1800~yrs BP from Mt Taranaki, New Zealand. These events spanned the eruption of differing bulk compositions and styles from two distinct vent locations; an andesitic sub-plinian eruption from the summit vent and a scoria cone-building eruption of basaltic magma from a satellite vent. Compositional profiles and zoning textures of plagioclase, amphibole and clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the opening andesitic event show evidence of magma mixing and subsequent crystallisation just prior to the initiation of the eruption episode. Titanomagnetite grain morphology and Ti variation suggest that the magma mixing event occurred within a few days to weeks before the eruption acting as a trigger for it. We present a magmatic model which is constrained by the petrological observations and eruptions of the episode. In this model magma differentiation at depth causes its rise and recharging of a mid-crustal magma storage area at 5\textendash 7~km. Although the recharging magma differed slightly in oxygen fugacity and temperature, it was compositionally and physically similar enough to the residing andesitic magma to allow efficient mixing. The petrological characteristics described here can be readily observed and enable identification of mixing events in other recent eruption episodes.},

This paper documents for the August 6, 2012 Te Maari eruption the upper level (troposphere) plume movement based on ash-detection algorithms applied to IR satellite imagery. It also presents the distribution of airborne ash and wind-influenced ashfall as determined by NAME-III aerial dispersion modelling using observed particle characteristics and grain size distribution measurements (that are also presented) and compares the ashfall with observations. The upper level (troposphere) ash movement was also evaluated from ash-detection algorithms, applied to infra-red satellite imagery and the resulting distributions were compared to those forecast by the numerical dispersion models. Forecasts of upper level ash-dispersion patterns explained the satellite imagery observations well, predicting the correct altitudes when using plausible ash size distributions and release levels. Patterns in proximal ashfall could only be partly explained by aerial dispersal of large particles released at low altitudes in the eruption column. The extreme distal (100\textendash 150km away) observed ashfall distributions also cannot be fully explained by NAME-III when using: reasonably prescribed initial particle size distributions, eruption column height, eruption timing, well forecast winds, and dry sedimentation processes. Aggregation and ice nucleation effects (observed in deposits) were not included in the ash dispersion model, but appear as a plausible mechanism to account for the observed fraction of wind dispersed ash particles {$<$}30{$\mu$}m deposited but not captured by the models.},

Different from other deep neural estimators such as variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, PCs enable large classes of tractable inference with little or no compromise in terms of model expressiveness. Moreover, while showing a unified view to learn PCs from data and several real-world applications, we cast many popular tractable models in the framework of PCs while theoretically tracing the boundaries of tractable probabilistic inference.

  abstract = {Variations in the spectral content of volcano seismicity related to changes in volcanic activity are commonly identified manually in spectrograms. However, long time series of monitoring data at volcano observatories require tools to facilitate automated and rapid processing. Techniques such as self-organizing maps (SOM) and principal component analysis (PCA) can help to quickly and automatically identify important patterns related to impending eruptions. For the first time, we evaluate the performance of SOM and PCA on synthetic volcano seismic spectra constructed from observations during two well-studied eruptions at Klauea Volcano, Hawai'i, that include features observed in many volcanic settings. In particular, our objective is to test which of the techniques can best retrieve a set of three spectral patterns that we used to compose a synthetic spectrogram. We find that, without a priori knowledge of the given set of patterns, neither SOM nor PCA can directly recover the spectra. We thus test hierarchical clustering, a commonly used method, to investigate whether clustering in the space of the principal components and on the SOM, respectively, can retrieve the known patterns. Our clustering method applied to the SOM fails to detect the correct number and shape of the known input spectra. In contrast, clustering of the data reconstructed by the first three PCA modes reproduces these patterns and their occurrence in time more consistently. This result suggests that PCA in combination with hierarchical clustering is a powerful practical tool for automated identification of characteristic patterns in volcano seismic spectra. Our results indicate that, in contrast to PCA, common clustering algorithms may not be ideal to group patterns on the SOM and that it is crucial to evaluate the performance of these tools on a control dataset prior to their application to real data.},

  abstract = {The quality of process data in a chemical plant significantly affects the performance and benefits gained from activities like performance monitoring, online optimization and control. Since many chemical processes often exhibit nonlinear dynamics, techniques like Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (NDDR) have been developed to improve the data quality. There are various issues that arise with the use of either of these techniques: EKF cannot handle inequality or equality constraints, while the NDDR has high computational cost. Recently a recursive estimation technique for nonlinear dynamic processes has been proposed which combines the merits of EKF and NDDR techniques. This technique, named as Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR), provides state and parameter estimates that satisfy bounds and other constraints imposed on them. However, the estimate error covariance matrix in RNDDR is computed in the same manner as in EKF, that is, the effects of both nonlinearity and constraints are neglected in the computation of the estimate error covariance matrix. A relatively new method known as the Unscented Kalman Filter has been developed for nonlinear processes, in which the statistical properties of the estimates are computed without resorting to linearization of the nonlinear equations. This leads to improved accuracy of the estimates. In this paper, we combine the merits of the Unscented Kalman Filter and the RNDDR to obtain the Unscented Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (URNDDR) technique. This technique addresses all concerns arising due to the presence of nonlinearity and constraints within a recursive estimation framework, resulting in an efficient, accurate and stable method for real-time state and parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamic processes. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {What makes a seismogram look like a seismogram? Seismic data sets generally contain waveforms sharing some set of visual characteristics and features-indeed, seismologists routinely exploit this when performing quality control 'by hand'. Understanding and harnessing these characteristics offers the prospect of a deeper understanding of seismic waveforms, and opens up many potential new techniques for processing and working with data. In addition, the fact that certain features are shared between waveforms suggests that it may be possible to transform the data away from the time domain, and represent the same information using fewer parameters. If so, this would be a significant step towards making fully non-linear tomographic inversions computationally tractable. Hinton \& Salakhutdinov showed that a particular class of neural network, termed 'autoencoder networks', may be used to find lower-dimensional encodings of complex binary data sets. Here, we adapt their work to the continuous case to allow the use of autoencoders for seismic waveforms, and offer a demonstration in which we compress 512-point waveforms to 32-element encodings. We also demonstrate that the mapping from data to encoding space, and its inverse, are well behaved, as required for many applications. Finally, we sketch a number of potential applications of the technique, which we hope will be of practical interest across all seismological disciplines, and beyond. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International \textcopyright{} 2012 RAS.},

As part of this study, two seismic refraction lines were shot across central South Island and offshore extensions of the continental crust in the Tasman Sea and Pacific Ocean. We present the data and a 603 km long seismic velocity profile of the crust and uppermost mantle along one of these seismic transects. A tomographic inversion of 62,563 travel times from crustal and upper mantle refractions and wide-angle reflections resulted in a model with a two-layer crust. Upper crustal velocities were between 5.9 and 6.3 km/s, and lower crustal velocities were between 6.5 and 7.0 km/s. Continental compression has locally reduced the seismic velocities in the Pacific plate crust by 0.2-0.3 km/s, a possible effect of high strain and fluids in the crust. The thickening of the crust from 28 km at the east coast of South Island to 37 km beneath the Southern Alps can account for about 25\% of the 80-110 km shortening of Pacific plate crust, while the rest must be accounted for by rapid erosion of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks on the west side of the orogen. In our model the lower crust forms a continuous 2-6 km thick layer beneath central South Island. The asymmetric topography of the Southern Alps is reflected in the crustal root which has a steeper flank at the west coast. This observation is consistent with westward underthrusting of Pacific lower lithosphere beneath South Island that has been suggested in earlier studies.

The base of the cylinder was heated, and the top was cooled, as in a natural hydrothermal system. Previous work had shown that once the two-phase zone reached a certain level, thermal instabilities would develop. We made measurements of the acoustic energy related to boiling, and we found that high levels of acoustic noise were associated with the part of the cycle in which there was upward water movement. We repeated our experiments with a cooling water tank at the top of the system, representing a crater lake. This showed that periodic thermal instabilities still developed in this situation. We then compared our analogue measurements to two natural systems known to exhibit periodic behavior. There is good agreement between the thermal and acoustic cycling seen in our model and the observations made at Inferno Crater Lake in the Waimangu Geothermal area, New Zealand, whose level cycles by nearly 10 m, with a typical period of 38 days. Particularly notable is how in both systems high levels of acoustic noise are associated with rising water level. The much larger Ruapehu Crater Lake, also in New Zealand, cycled with a period of several months to a year for over a decade prior to the 1995 eruption. Strong acoustic and seismic energy usually occurred just before the lake temperature started to rise. This suggests a slightly different model, in which the increasing two-phase flow zone triggers more general convection once it reaches the base of the lake.},

  abstract = {The lake level and temperature of Inferno Crater Lake, a hot lake in the Waimangu Geothermal Field, vary in quasiregular cycles with a period of about 30 to 50 days. Between 1970 and 1991, several hydrothermal eruptions at other sites within the Waimangu system affected this cycling, especially the cycle period. This indicated that although the cycling was most evident in one small lake, it was sensitive to any changes in the surrounding geothermal system. After the Raupo Pond eruption, which produced the largest effects, the recovery of the temperature and cycle period was consistent with extra energy diffusing out of the previously proposed heat pipe system. The 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake, whose hypocenter was 50 km from Waimangu, also seems to have significantly affected the hydrothermal system, reducing the cycle period for at least a year afterwards.},

  abstract = {We present a new method and implementation (Instaseis) to store global Green's functions in a database which allows for near-instantaneous (on the order of milliseconds) extraction of arbitrary seismograms. Using the axisymmetric spectral element method (AxiSEM), the generation of these databases, based on reciprocity of the Green's functions, is very efficient and is approximately half as expensive as a single AxiSEM forward run. Thus, this enables the computation of full databases at half the cost of the computation of seismograms for a single source in the previous scheme and allows to compute databases at the highest frequencies globally observed. By storing the basis coefficients of the numerical scheme (Lagrange polynomials), the Green's functions are 4th order accurate in space and the spatial discretization respects discontinuities in the velocity model exactly. High-order temporal interpolation using Lanczos resampling allows to retrieve seismograms at any sampling rate. AxiSEM is easily adaptable to arbitrary spherically symmetric models of Earth as well as other planets. In this paper, we present the basic rationale and details of the method as well as benchmarks and illustrate a variety of applications. The code is open source and available with extensive documentation at www.instaseis.net.}

The database contains 276 New Zealand earthquakes that were recorded by strong motion instruments from GeoNet and earlier network operators. The events have moment magnitudes ranging from 3.5 to 7.8. A total of 134 of these events (49\%) have been classified as occurring in the overlying crust, with 33 events (12\%) located on the Fiordland subduction interface and 7 on the Hikurangi subduction interface (3\%). 8 events (3\%) are deemed to have occurred within the subducting Australian Plate at the Fiordland subduction zone, and 94 events (34\%) within the subducting Pacific Plate on the Hikurangi subduction zone. There arc a total of 4,148 uniformly-processed recordings associated with these earthquakes, from which acceleration, velocity and displacement time-series, Fourier amplitude spectra of acceleration, and acceleration response spectra have been computed. 598 recordings from the New Zealand database are identified as being suitable for future use in time-domain analyses of structural response.

One of the potential origins of the inflated variability is the simplified model-fitting techniques used in most source spectral studies. This study examines a variety of model-fitting methods and shows that the choice of method can explain some of the discrepancy. The preferred method is Bayesian hierarchical modeling, which can reduce bias, better quantify uncertainties, and allow additional effects to be resolved. Two case study earthquakes are examined, the 2016 MW7.1 Kumamoto, Japan earthquake and a MW5.3 aftershock of the 2016 MW7.8 Kaik\=oura earthquake. By using hierarchical models, the variation of the corner frequency, fc, and the falloff rate, n, across the focal sphere can be retrieved without overfitting the data. Other methods commonly used to calculate corner frequencies may give substantial biases. In particular, if fc was calculated for the Kumamoto earthquake using an {$\omega$}-square model, the obtained fc could be twice as large as a realistic value.},

  abstract = {Particle filters contain the promise of fully nonlinear data assimilation. They have been applied in numerous science areas, including the geosciences, but their application to high-dimensional geoscience systems has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localization and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state-of-the-art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for high-dimensional nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems, with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, including pseudo-code, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction, suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.},

Using a method developed by Haines relating shear strains to the total strain and velocity fields, the dila-tational and rotational strain rates and the velocities within the deformed zone are derived. The plate boundary zone is shown to be two-dimensional, for the most part, in that gradients of the velocity along the length of the zone are small or zero. The shear strain rates are not uniform, however; they reach a maximum along a central axis and decrease gradually to zero toward the sides. Nor are the two independent components of strain, one involving shortening (or extension) perpendicular, and the other shear parallel, to the zone equally developed everywhere; there is a clear geographic separation with shortening developed over the subduction thrust and shear developed behind in a zone of wrench faulting. Time variations in the strain field in part of the region above the subduction interface are related to changes in the degree of coupling across the interface. A velocity field is computed: the relative velocity of the two plates from this data agree very well with that derived from seafloor spreading data. These strain and velocity fields derived from geodetic studies give the short-term kinematics of the plate boundary zone. The long-term kinematics of the zone are estimated from: (1) uplift and subsidence data which are related to changes in crustal thickness and hence to dilatational strain, and (2) variation in the declination of primary magnetization in rocks of known age, related to the rotational strain. The rate of rotational strain has increased in time from about 2 to 3\textdegree Myr\textasciitilde 1, lOMyr ago, to about 9\textdegree Myr\textasciitilde 1 today. The increase can be understood as a secondary effect of a developing compressional component increasing the coupling between the plates so that more of the motion parallel to the zone is accommodated by distributed shear and less by aseismic slip. The rates of strain averaged over the last 1 Myr or so, and at a scale length of a few tens of kilometres, are closely similar in distribution and magnitude to the strain rates derived from short-term kinematics. While, therefore, at scale lengths of a few hundred metres or so faulting is very important and the deformation is discontinuous with unstrained blocks faulted, with large but uncertain slip, against adjacent blocks, the deformation at these longer-scale lengths is continuous and regular. The two consequences of this study are that: (1) strain from geodetic data can be directly related to the average long-term deformation and therefore can be an important tool in the study of deformation in regions of current tectonic activity, and (2) at scale lengths of a few tens of kilometres the deformation of a region can be described as the deformation of a continuum and we can ignore the effects of faulting.},

For calibration, we use global 30 arc sec topographic  data and VS30 measurements (here VS30 refers to the average shear-velocity down to 30 m) aggregated from several studies in the United States, as well as in Taiwan,  Italy, and Australia. VS30 values are correlated against topographic slope to develop  two sets of parameters for deriving VS30: one for active tectonic regions where topographic  relief is high, and one for stable shields where topography is more subdued.  By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize  the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first  order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for  California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the VS30 observations in that region despite rather low slope  ranges.We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated  with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the  latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to  match observed VS30 measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based  method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping.After validating this approach in regions with numerous VS30 observations, we  subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States  using the respective slope correlations.},

  abstract = {Bayes' rule is used to combine likelihood and prior probability distributions. The former represents knowledge derived from new data, the latter represents pre-existing knowledge; the Bayesian combination is the so-called posterior distribution, representing the resultant new state of knowledge. While varying the likelihood due to differing data observations is common, there are also situations where the prior distribution must be changed or replaced repeatedly. For example, in mixture density neural network (MDN) inversion, using current methods the neural network employed for inversion needs to be retrained every time prior information changes. We develop a method of prior replacement to vary the prior without re-training the network. Thus the efficiency of MDN inversions can be increased, typically by orders of magnitude when applied to geophysical problems. We demonstrate this for the inversion of seismic attributes in a synthetic subsurface geological reservoir model. We also present results which suggest that prior replacement can be used to control the statistical properties (such as variance) of the final estimate of the posterior in more general (e.g., Monte Carlo based) inverse problem solutions.},

The ASL produced location discrepancies larger than 1.0~km laterally and 500~m in depth by using independently determined velocity model, attenuation, and site amplification factors (AFs). Sensitivity tests for ASL input parameters show that attenuation and velocity have moderate influence on the location but are easy to independently constrain. AFs are shown to strongly influence the location, and their application may introduce substantial location uncertainties. Model uncertainties are accommodated with either lateral or depth changes depending on the input parameters, station corrections, and the source-station geometry.},

  abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},

Algorithms include expectation-maximization (EM), dual Kalman filtering, and joint Kalman methods. These methods have recently been explored in the context of nonlinear modeling, where a neural network is used as the functional form of the unknown model. Typically, an ex- tended Kalman filter (EKF) or smoother is used for the part of the al- gorithm that estimates the clean state given the current estimated model. An EKF may also be used to estimate the weights of the network. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and proposes an improve- ment based on a new approach called the unscented transformation (UT) [3]. A substantial performance gain is achieved with the same order of computational complexity as that of the standard EKF. The approach is illustrated on several dual estimation methods.},

Geothermal fields are well known to be susceptible to triggering, as the injection and extraction activities change the local stress and fluid flow conditions. Here, we examine the modulation of earthquakes by Earth tides within California's Coso geothermal field (CGF) and its vicinity. To maximize our resolution to detect modulation of small earthquakes, we take advantage of the new Quake Template Matching catalog in southern California, which has nearly twice as many events in the Coso region as the standard catalog and is complete down to about magnitude 0.3. We observe strong tidal triggering of earthquakes within the CGF, even though the fluctuations of tidal stresses are small ({$\sim$}2 kPa). The tidally-triggered earthquakes tend to occur near the time of maximum tensile tidal stress. The signal is strongest near the edges of the zone of new production wells, suggesting fluid pressure gradients encourages triggering at tidal periods.},

  abstract = {The wave-field of volcano-induced seismic signals at Stromboli volcano (Italy) was observed using a network of four broadband seismometers. In addition to the standard spectral analysis of the recorded signals, new spectral techniques such as wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis were also used in order to discriminate between signals related to volcanic tremor and volcanic explosions. The common features of these two types of signals are characterised by the maximum of the power spectral density values located in the frequency band {$>$} 2.0 Hz, and the main orientation of the principal axes of the particle motion ellipsoids in the frequency bands analysed. The seismic signals of the volcanic explosions at Stromboli cover the total frequency band, whereas the spectral content of the volcanic tremor is restricted to narrow frequency bands ranging from 0.3\textendash 5.0 Hz. In order to localize both types of signals, a modified inversion technique was used. The result of this beam-forming on diffraction hyperboloids of both types of signals reveal a surprisingly shallow source location ranging from 0.2 km\textendash 0.7 km above sea level, suggesting that the sources of the volcanic explosions, as well as of the volcanic tremor, are restricted to the uppermost parts of the volcano. This is in agreement with several nonseismological observations of this volcano. The combination of spectral analysis of volcanic tremor and volcanic explosions with the analysis of ground displacement implies a mechanism which can be described by an ascending bubble of volcanic gas in a nearly closed volcanic system, and finally the forced ejection of the material through a narrow channel at the top of the magma column.},

  abstract = {Observations show that the seismic normal modes of the Earth at frequencies near 10 mHz are excited at a nearly constant level in the absence of large earthquakes. This background level of excitation has been called the 'hum' of the Earth, and is equivalent to the maximum excitation from a magnitude 5.75 earthquake. Its origin is debated, with most studies attributing the forcing to atmospheric turbulence, analogous to the forcing of solar oscillations by solar turbulence. Some reports also predicted that turbulence might excite the planetary modes of Mars to detectable levels. Recent observations on Earth, however, suggest that the predominant excitation source lies under the oceans. Here I show that turbulence is a very weak source, and instead it is interacting ocean waves over the shallow continental shelves that drive the hum of the Earth. Ocean waves couple into seismic waves through the quadratic nonlinearity of the surface boundary condition, which couples pairs of slowly propagating ocean waves of similar frequency to a high phase velocity component at approximately double the frequency. This is the process by which ocean waves generate the well known 'microseism peak' that dominates the seismic spectrum near 140 mHz (refs 11, 12), but at hum frequencies, the mechanism differs significantly in frequency and depth dependence. A calculation of the coupling between ocean waves and seismic modes reproduces the seismic spectrum observed. Measurements of the temporal correlation between ocean wave data and seismic data have confirmed that ocean waves, rather than atmospheric turbulence, are driving the modes of the Earth.},

  abstract = {The amount of data being generated by the geothermal industry is increasing exponentially. Advanced tools, higher resolution sensors, and digitally integrated equipment are providing valuable insight into geothermal exploration and operational efficiencies, but the volumes of data they generate and the unique properties of Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) projects are creating challenges of their own. This paper explores those challenges and the steps the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is taking to address them through comprehensive data management strategies, improvements to DOE's Geothermal Data Repository (GDR), and the development of a secure data collaboration tool for DOE's Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) and EGS Collab projects. 1. GEOTHERMAL DATA CHALLENGES Data-driven innovation is propelling the petroleum industry to new heights. The collection and analysis of big data from seismic arrays is giving companies like Shell higher resolution and more accurate pictures of target reservoirs (Marr 2015) and helping others gain efficiency and operational insight (Venables ,2018). Advances in instrumentation including smaller, more affordable sensors, Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Distributed Stress Sensing (DSS) fiber optic cables, and networks of interconnected devices are making the collection of downhole data easier and more prolific. For example, the analysis of Rayleigh backscattering of Ultra Violet (UV) light in DTS cables and DSS cables is increasing their resolution by several orders of magnitude, allowing, in some cases, the measurement of temperature and stress at 1cm intervals (Loranger et al. 2015). Leveraging these advances to gain valuable insight into exploration, operational efficiencies, and EGS stimulation projects, the geothermal industry is generating more data than ever before (Weers and Anderson 2016). Timely access to these data can inform exploration, minimize risk during drilling, enable teams to make smarter decisions, and increase the efficiency of geothermal operations. However, the volume of data being generated can present its own series of challenges. Data that are too large or too complex to store, transport, or utilize via conventional means (i.e. "big data") can be difficult to process effectively. Additionally, data from geothermal exploration and drilling projects can be more difficult to acquire than their petroleum counterparts.},

The water surface temperature is specified, and the surface roughness is taken to be constant over land and water. The turbulent fluxes are formulated by a semiempirical turbulence theory with the Businger-Dyer form of the Monin-Obukhov similarity functions, a water vapor buoyancy term in the Obukhov stability length, and Blackadar's scaling height in the mixing length. The resulting solution of the equations of conservation shows that the stability discontinuity at the leading edge can greatly affect the mean rate of evaporation and that the vertical vapor flux can greatly contribute to the atmospheric stability. The solution is relatively insensitive to the exact form of the Monin-Obukhov similarity functions or to the exactness of Reynolds' analogy or von Karman's constant. For large fetches and near-neutral conditions the solution becomes similar to that obtained in Sutton's problem and with Harbeck's empirical formula.},

  abstract = {The active fault traces on which earthquakes occur are generally not continuous, and are commonly composed of segments that are separated by discontinuities that appear as steps in map-view. Stress concentrations resulting from slip at such discontinuities may slow or stop rupture propagation and hence play a controlling role in limiting the length of earthquake rupture. Here I examine the mapped surface rupture traces of 22 historical strike-slip earthquakes with rupture lengths ranging between 10 and 420 km. I show that about two-thirds of the endpoints of strike-slip earthquake ruptures are associated with fault steps or the termini of active fault traces, and that there exists a limiting dimension of fault step (3-4 km) above which earthquake ruptures do not propagate and below which rupture propagation ceases only about 40 per cent of the time. The results are of practical importance to seismic hazard analysis where effort is spent attempting to place limits on the probable length of future earthquakes on mapped active faults. Physical insight to the dynamics of the earthquake rupture process is further gained with the observation that the limiting dimension appears to be largely independent of the earthquake rupture length. It follows that the magnitude of stress changes and the volume affected by those stress changes at the driving edge of laterally propagating ruptures are largely similar and invariable during the rupture process regardless of the distance an event has propagated or will propagate.},

  abstract = {We present data on 136 high-frequency earthquakes and swarms, termed volcano-tectonic (VT) seismicity, which preceded 111 eruptions at 83 volcanoes, plus data on VT swarms that preceded intrusions at 21 other volcanoes. We find that VT seismicity is usually the earliest reported seismic precursor for eruptions at volcanoes that have been dormant for decades or more, and precedes eruptions of all magma types from basaltic to rhyolitic and all explosivities from VEI 0 to ultraplinian VEI 6 at such previously long-dormant volcanoes. Because large eruptions occur most commonly during resumption of activity at long-dormant volcanoes, VT seismicity is an important precursor for the Earth's most dangerous eruptions. VT seismicity precedes all explosive eruptions of VEI {$\geq$} 5 and most if not all VEI 4 eruptions in our data set. Surprisingly we find that the VT seismicity originates at distal locations on tectonic fault structures at distances of one or two to tens of kilometers laterally from the site of the eventual eruption, and rarely if ever starts beneath the eruption site itself. The distal VT swarms generally occur at depths almost equal to the horizontal distance of the swarm from the summit out to about 15. km distance, beyond which hypocenter depths level out. We summarize several important characteristics of this distal VT seismicity including: swarm-like nature, onset days to years prior to the beginning of magmatic eruptions, peaking of activity at the time of the initial eruption whether phreatic or magmatic, and large non-double couple component to focal mechanisms. Most importantly we show that the intruded magma volume can be simply estimated from the cumulative seismic moment of the VT seismicity from:. Log10 V=0.71 Log10{$\sigma$}Moment-5.32, with volume, V, in cubic meters and seismic moment in Newton meters. Because the cumulative seismic moment can be approximated from the size of just the few largest events, and is quite insensitive to precise locations, the intruded magma volume can be quickly and easily estimated with few short-period seismic stations.Notable cases in which distal VT events preceded eruptions at long-dormant volcanoes include: Nevado del Ruiz (1984-1985), Pinatubo (1991), Unzen (1989-1995), Soufriere Hills (1995), Shishaldin (1989-1999), Tacana' (1985-1986), Pacaya (1980-1984), Rabaul (1994), and Cotopaxi (2001). Additional cases are recognized at frequently active volcanoes including Popocateptl (2001-2003) and Mauna Loa (1984). We present four case studies (Pinatubo, Soufriere Hills, Unzen, and Tacana') in which we demonstrate the above mentioned VT characteristics prior to eruptions. Using regional data recorded by NEIC, we recognized in near-real time that a huge distal VT swarm was occurring, deduced that a proportionately huge magmatic intrusion was taking place beneath the long dormant Sulu Range, New Britain Island, Papua New Guinea, that it was likely to lead to eruptive activity, and warned Rabaul Volcano Observatory days before a phreatic eruption occurred. This confirms the value of this technique for eruption forecasting. We also present a counter-example where we deduced that a VT swarm at Volcan Cosiguina, Nicaragua, indicated a small intrusion, insufficient to reach the surface and erupt. Finally, we discuss limitations of the method and propose a mechanism by which this distal VT seismicity is triggered by magmatic intrusion.},

As a demonstration of its capabilities, pestpp-ies is applied to a synthetic groundwater model with thousands of parameters and to a real-world groundwater flow and transport model with tens of thousands of parameters. pestpp-ies is shown to efficiently and effectively condition parameters in both cases and can provide means to estimate posterior forecast uncertainty when the forecasts depend on large numbers of parameters.},

  abstract = {For accurate and timely information on the evolving state of our volcanoes we need reliable short-term forecasts. These forecasts directly impact crisis management from evacuations, exclusion zones, and when it is safe to return. Eruption forecasting should not be viewed as an academic exercise or a theoretical discussion in a back room, nor is now the time for dramatic data interpretations or a set of `we-told-you-so' hindcasting demonstrations. To produce a short-term eruption forecast, a systematic evaluation of options is required with a critical assessment of outstanding issues and assumption validity. We run this lens over a set of existing short-term eruption forecasting methods and provide a straightforward data-driven methodology for forecast selection. Six eruption forecasting methods are discussed here: (1) Expert interpretation, (2) Event trees, (3) Belief networks, (4) Failure forecasting, (5) Process / Source models, and (6) Machine-learning algorithms with a view to forecasting: (1) Eruption occurrence (onset time), (2) Eruptive vent location(s), (3) Eruption size, (4) Initial eruption style/phase, (5) Eruption phase duration, and (6) Eruption specific hazards. This work constitutes a decision tool that can be directly applied to a volcanic system of interest to determine which eruption forecasting methods are possible, plausible, and with what implementation steps. Accompanying this is an extensive evaluation of assumption validity (and assumption avoidance options) to ensure the accurate and transparent application of any eruption forecasting method. Significant potential is identified in methods that are generally data-hungry (e.g., belief networks and machine-learning algorithms), and/or by the coupling of probabilistic methods to process/source models. However, as most volcanic systems are data-poor, expert interpretation and event trees remain the only currently available forecasting methods that can be readily and widely applied during volcanic crises.},

The Wills et~al. (2000) site-condition map for California was found to correlate with seismic amplification (Field, 2000) and was adopted as a standard depiction for many applications of seismic shaking estimates (ShakeMap, for example). Wills and Clahan (2006) modified that map to show simplified geologic units and corresponding VS30 values. Preparation of this map raised a number of questions on how best to distinguish units within younger alluvium. Wills and Gutierrez (2011) found that a simple system based on surface slope could be used to subdivide the younger alluvium into three classes that have distinct VS30 ranges. The classes defined by slope have approximately the same variability in VS30 as the previously defined classes, but the total number of classes is reduced and the system can be easily applied to other tectonically active areas. We have now applied the system of Wills and Gutierrez (2011) to create a new map of California using the most detailed available geologic maps. Use of more detailed geologic maps, from 1:250,000 scale to 1:24,000 for much of California, results in a much more detailed and accurate depiction of the surficial geology and, we anticipate, a more detailed and accurate depiction of seismic amplification due to the near-surface materials.Online Material: Site-condition map of California at a scale of 1:1,500,000, as well as in ArcGIS formats.},

These observations suggest that distributed deformation, not slip on a narrow vertical fault, accommodates displacement in the lower crust below the 120-480 km of right-lateral slip across the Wairau fault, one splay of the Marlborough fault system, and the northward continuation of the Alpine fault. Beneath the Wairau fault, the Moho dips 25-deg-30-deg southeast from a depth of \textasciitilde 26 km northwest of the fault to a depth of \textasciitilde 34 km southeast of the fault. Farther to the southeast, Ps conversions from the Moho continue under the Awatere fault (34 +- 10 km of slip) with a constant amplitude and depth of \textasciitilde 34 km. Across the two faults, converted energy from 16-20 km depth varies with back-azimuth in a manner suggesting the presence of anisotropy in the lower crust. These observations imply that one of the tenets of plate tectonics, that faults defining plate boundaries pass through both crust and upper mantle, does not apply to New Zealand, or to continents in general.}

Knowledge of the likely impacts can support mitigation actions, crisis planning, and emergency management activities. This chapter presents an overview of ash fall impacts for sectors of society including buildings, critical infrastructure, and agriculture; and discuss associated socioeconomic factors. We also discuss the likely response (vulnerability) of these key sectors to ash fall impacts. Broad relationships between volcanic ash thickness and levels of damage and disruption have been outlined. Understanding these vulnerabilities is an essential step towards building resilience for communities.},

  abstract = {Eleven equations for calculating evaporation were compared with evaporation determined by the energy budget method for Williams Lake, Minnesota. Data were obtained from instruments on a raft, on land near the lake, and at a weather station 60 km south of the lake. The comparisons were based on monthly values for the open-water periods of 5 years, a total of 22 months. A modified DeBruin-Keijman, Priestley-Taylor, and a modified Penman equation resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed most closely with energy budget values. To use these equations, net radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity need to be measured near the lake. In addition, thermal surveys need to be made to determine change in heat stored in the lake. If data from distant climate stations are the only data available, and they include solar radiation, the Jensen-Haise and Makkink equations resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed reasonably well with energy budget values.},

  abstract = {Video cameras are common at volcano observatories, but their utility is often limited during periods of crisis due to the large data volume from continuous acquisition and time requirements for manual analysis. For cameras to serve as effective monitoring tools, video frames must be synthesized into relevant time series signals and further analyzed to classify and characterize observable activity. In this study, we use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify periods of volcanic activity and quantify plume rise velocities from video observations. Data were collected at Villarrica Volcano, Chile from two visible band cameras located \textasciitilde 17~\hspace{0pt}km from the vent that recorded at 0.1 and 30 frames per second between February and April 2015. Over these two months, Villarrica exhibited a diverse range of eruptive activity, including a paroxysmal eruption on 3 March. Prior to and after the eruption, activity included nighttime incandescence, dark and light emissions, inactivity, and periods of cloud cover. We quantify the color and spatial extent of plume emissions using a blob detection algorithm, whose outputs are fed into a trained artificial neural network that categorizes the observable activity into five classes. Activity shifts from primarily nighttime incandescence to ash emissions following the 3 March paroxysm, which likely relates to the reemergence of the buried lava lake. Time periods exhibiting plume emissions are further analyzed using a row and column projection algorithm that identifies plume onsets and calculates apparent plume horizontal and vertical rise velocities. Plume onsets are episodic, occurring with an average period of \textasciitilde 50~\hspace{0pt}s and suggests a puffing style of degassing, which is commonly observed at Villarrica. However, the lack of clear acoustic transients in the accompanying infrasound record suggests puffing may be controlled by atmospheric effects rather than a degassing regime at the vent. Methods presented here offer a generalized toolset for volcano monitors to classify and track emission statistics at a variety of volcanoes to better monitor periods of unrest and ultimately forecast major eruptions.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) methods have seen widespread adoption in seismology in recent years. The ability of these techniques to efficiently infer the statistical properties of large datasets often provides significant improvements over traditional techniques when the number of data are large(\guillemotright millions of examples). With the entire spectrum of seismological tasks, e.g., seismic picking and detection, magnitude and source property estimation, ground motion prediction, hypocentre determination; among others, now incorporating ML approaches, numerous models are emerging as these techniques are further adopted within seismology. To evaluate these algorithms, quality controlled benchmark datasets that contain representative class distributions are vital. In addition to this, models require implementation through a common framework to facilitate comparison. Accessing these various benchmark datasets for training and implementing the standardization of models is currently a time-consuming process, hindering further advancement of ML techniques within seismology. These development bottlenecks also affect 'practitioners' seeking to deploy the latest models on seismic data, without having to necessarily learn entirely new ML frameworks to perform this task. We present SeisBench as a software package to tackle these issues. SeisBench is an open-source framework for deploying ML in seismology. SeisBench standardises access to both models and datasets, whilst also providing a range of common processing and data augmentation operations through the API. Through SeisBench, users can access several seismological ML models and benchmark datasets available in the literature via a single interface. SeisBench is built to be extensible, with community involvement encouraged to expand the package. Having such frameworks available for accessing leading ML models forms an essential tool for seismologists seeking to iterate and apply the next generation of ML techniques to seismic data.},

  abstract = {Swimming pools as thermal sinks for air conditioners could save approximately 40\% on peak cooling power and 30\% of overall cooling energy, compared to standard residential air conditioning. Heat dissipation from pools in semi-arid climates with large diurnal temperature shifts is such that pool heating and space cooling may occur concurrently; in which case heat rejected from cooling equipment could directly displace pool heating energy, while also improving space cooling efficiency. The performance of such a system relies on the natural temperature regulation of swimming pools governed by evaporative and convective heat exchange with the air, radiative heat exchange with the sky, and conductive heat exchange with the ground. This paper describes and validates a model that uses meteorological data to accurately predict the hourly temperature of a swimming pool to within 1.1~\textdegree C maximum error over the period of observation. A thorough review of literature guided our choice of the most appropriate set of equations to describe the natural mass and energy exchange between a swimming pool and the environment. Monitoring of a pool in Davis, CA, was used to confirm the resulting simulations. Comparison of predicted and observed pool temperature for all hours over a 56 day experimental period shows an R-squared relatedness of 0.967.},

Since that time, the character of eruptions has changed, from phreatic to phreatomagmatic to magmatic explosive eruptions, and from production of a lava dome that collapsed to a subsequent thick lava flow that slowly ceased to be active, and later, to a new lava dome. As the eruption progressed, event trees were constructed to forecast eruptive behavior six times, with forecast windows that ranged from 2weeks to 1year: November 7\textendash 10, December 12\textendash 14, and December 27, 2013; and January 9\textendash 10, May 13, and October 7, 2014. These event trees were successful in helping to frame the forecast scenarios, to collate current monitoring information, and to document outstanding questions and unknowns. The highest probability forecasts closely matched outcomes of eruption size (including extrusion of the first dome), production of pyroclastic density currents, and pyroclastic density current runout distances. Events assigned low probabilities also occurred, including total collapse of the lava dome in January 2014 and production of a small blast pyroclastic density current in February 2014.},

In particular, we have depicted the detailed features of the changes in the surface air temperature of Hong Kong (HK) during the past 115 years. Analysis of the time-frequency spectra of the wavelet transform indicates that although seasonal variations account for most of the temperature variations, strong signals also exist on subseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales. Though the strong seasonal cycle is marked by a minimum temperature in February (and then in January) and a maximum temperature in July (and then in August), strong variations on the subseasonal and interannual time scales occur mostly in February and then in March. It is also found that a rising tendency exists in the long-recorded temperature data, with a rate of 0.09-0.15 \textdegree C per decade.Temperature variations in HK are strongly related to changes in the regional and remote atmospheric circulation on various time scales. The East Asian monsoon circulation is the main factor controlling the seasonal cycle and the subseasonal and interannual variations of the HK temperature during winter. The subseasonal and seasonal variations of the temperature are also associated with changes in the atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific, which is closely linked to the East Asian jet stream. Strong signals are also found in both this mid-latitude circulation and the El Ni\~no-southern oscillation phenomenon when the interannual variability of the HK temperature is apparent.

  abstract = {In a medium-to-large earthquake, there are often reports of people being trapped or injured in elevators. This study investigates using an earthquake early warning (EEW) system, which provides seconds to tens of seconds warning before seismic waves arrive at a site, to help people escape from the elevators before a strong shaking arrives. However, such an application remains as a major engineering challenge due to the uncertainty of the EEW information and the short lead time available. A recent study presented an earthquake probability-based automated decision-making (ePAD) framework to address these issues. This paper focuses on studying the influence of two commonly ignored factors, uncertainty of warning and lead time, on the decision of stopping the elevators and opening the doors when an EEW message is received. Application of the ePAD framework requires using the performance-based earthquake engineering methodology for elevator damage prediction, making decision based on a cost-benefit model and reducing computational time with a surrogate model. The authors' results show that ePAD can provide rational decisions for elevator control based on EEW information under different amounts of lead time and uncertainty level of the warning.

  abstract = {An earthquake early warning (EEW) system rapidly analyzes seismic data to report the occurrence of an earthquake before strong shaking is felt at a site. In Japan, the integrated particle filter (IPF) method, a new source-estimation algorithm, was recently incorporated into the EEW system to improve the source-estimation accuracy during active seismicity. The problem of the current IPF method is that it uses the trigger information computed at each station in a specific format as the input and is therefore applicable to only limited seismic networks. This study proposes the extended IPF (IPFx) method to deal with continuous waveforms and merge all Japanese real-time seismic networks into a single framework. The new source determination algorithm processes seismic waveforms in two stages. The first stage (single-station processing) extracts trigger and amplitude information from continuous waveforms. The second stage (network processing) accumulates information from multiple stations and estimates the location and magnitude of ongoing earthquakes based on Bayesian inference. In 10 months of continuous online experiments, the IPFx method showed good performance in detecting earthquakes with maximum seismic intensity {$\geq$}3 in the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog. By merging multiple seismic networks into a single EEW system, the warning time of the current EEW system can be improved further. The IPFx method provides accurate shaking estimation even at the beginning of event detection and achieves seismic intensity error \&lt;0.25\,\,s after detecting an event. This method correctly avoided two major false alarms on 5 January 2018 and 30 July 2020. The IPFx method offers the potential of expanding the JMA IPF method to global seismic networks.},

This is exacerbated by the fact that new simulations must be performed whenever the velocity structure or source location is perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called neural operator. A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method's applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.},

Earthquake detection\textemdash identification of seismic events in continuous data\textemdash is a fundamental operation for observational seismology. We developed an efficient method to detect earthquakes using waveform similarity that overcomes the disadvantages of existing detection methods. Our method, called Fingerprint And Similarity Thresholding (FAST), can analyze a week of continuous seismic waveform data in less than 2 hours, or 140 times faster than autocorrelation. FAST adapts a data mining algorithm, originally designed to identify similar audio clips within large databases; it first creates compact ``fingerprints'' of waveforms by extracting key discriminative features, then groups similar fingerprints together within a database to facilitate fast, scalable search for similar fingerprint pairs, and finally generates a list of earthquake detections. FAST detected most (21 of 24) cataloged earthquakes and 68 uncataloged earthquakes in 1 week of continuous data from a station located near the Calaveras Fault in central California, achieving detection performance comparable to that of autocorrelation, with some additional false detections. FAST is expected to realize its full potential when applied to extremely long duration data sets over a distributed network of seismic stations. The widespread application of FAST has the potential to aid in the discovery of unexpected seismic signals, improve seismic monitoring, and promote a greater understanding of a variety of earthquake processes.}

  abstract = {Lateral variations in azimuthal anisotropy cause significant waveform anomalies in long-period surface waves ({$f$} {$<$} 15 mHz, T {$\greaterequivlnt$} 70 s), as a result of coupling between fundamental branch Rayleigh and Love waves. These anomalies, termed ``quasi-Love'' (QL) waves, have elliptical polarization, arrive slightly behind the Love wave but prior to the Rayleigh wave, and are observed on many propagation paths in the Pacific Ocean region. Our observations of quasi-Love waves indicate the existence of strong lateral anisotropic gradients in the western Pacific Ocean, in particular, near Hawaii and seaward of the Tonga-Kermadec, Kurile and Marianas-Izu-Bonin subduction zones. A lack of quasi-Love generation beneath the Phillipine Sea suggests weak azimuthal anisotropy in the region. In the southwest Pacific Ocean, the long-period quasi-Love waveforms recorded at station SNZO (South Karori, New Zealand) can be fit well with a simple anisotropic Earth model with a 90\textdegree{} rotation in the orientation of the fast P velocity axis near the boundary between the Indo-Australian and the Pacific plates. In this model, 6\% P wave velocity anisotropy from the Moho to 210 km depth, with a NNE-SSW fast direction (roughly parallel to the plate boundary), extends 500\textendash 1000 km east of the Tonga-Kermadec trench, where it shifts to a WNW-ESE orientation (parallel to fracture zones in the southernmost Pacific plate). This solution is nonunique, however, as a similar lateral variation of 2\% S wave anisotropy at asthenospheric depths (100\textendash 300 km) generates similar waveform anomalies. We attribute the laterally varying anisotropy to either (1) flow variations in the asthenosphere, consistent with lateral shear detected in deep Tonga-Kermadec seismicity, (2) variations in fossil spreading direction in the Cretaceous long normal polarity interval, (3) the disturbance of fossil anisotropy caused by the passage of the Louisville Ridge hotspot, and (4) lithospheric compression associated with continental collision along the Alpine Fault. The apparent location of the Love-to-Rayleigh ``scatterer'' favors options 1 and 3. Gradients in azimuthal anisotropy are inferred in the northwestern Pacific, associated with one or more of these mechanisms. A quasi-Love wave observed on a path from Alaska to PPT (Papeete, Tahiti) is bandlimited to {$f$} {$>$} 8 mHz, suggesting lateral variations with wavelength twice the spacing of fracture zones in the north central Pacific.},

  abstract = {Fracture density estimation is an indisputable challenge in fractured reservoir characterization. Traditional techniques of fracture characterization from core data are costly, time consuming, and difficult to use for any extrapolation to non-cored wells. The aim of this paper is to construct a model able to predict fracture density from conventional well logs calibrated to core data by using artificial neural networks (ANNs). This technique was tested in the Cambro-Ordovician clastic reservoir from Mesdar oil field (Saharan platform, Algeria). For this purpose, 170 cores (2120.14. m) from 17 unoriented wells have been studied in detail. Seven training algorithms and eight neuronal network architectures were tested.The best architecture is a four layered [6-16-3-1] network model with: a six-neuron input layer (Gamma ray, Sonic interval transit time, Caliper, Neutron porosity, Bulk density logs and core depth), two hidden layers; the first hidden layer has 16 neurons, the second one has three neurons. And a one-neuron output layer (fracture density). The results based on 8094 data points from 13 wells show the excellent prediction ability of the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) training algorithm (R-squared. =. 0.812).The cross plot of measured and predicted values of fracture density shows a very high coefficient of determination of 0.848. Our studies have demonstrated a good agreement between our neural network model prediction and core fracture measurements. The results are promising and can be easily extended in other similar neighboring naturally fractured reservoirs. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Very strong signals with apparent velocity higher than Rayleigh wave velocity are observed on noise correlation functions (NCFs) between seismic stations in East Asia. These signals are present on one-month NCFs in ten years period with stable arrival times, indicating their persistent and localized nature. The signals are strong in the frequency band of 0.07-0.12Hz, and their amplitudes show inter-annual but not seasonal variation. Location obtained from two algorithms with GSN and FNET data indicates that the source is situated in Kyushu Island, Japan. After an earthquake is used to account for heterogeneity effects, the location is closer to the Ariake bay but still in the island. The non-seasonal amplitude variation and the peak frequency of 0.1Hz suggest the signals are probably not generated by oceanic sources. This persistent localized microseismic source needs to be taken into consideration in ambient noise tomography studies in East Asia. \textcopyright{} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

In this study, we used a 7.6~km dark fiber in Tangshan, China, to monitor seismicity after the 12 July 2020 Ms~5.1 earthquake. The DAS array detected dozens of earthquakes missed by the local permanent network that doubled the number of aftershocks. The relocated aftershocks are distributed mainly north of the DAS array, and the ground-motion pattern changes also hint small-scale features. Our successful results demonstrate the feasibility of using DAS and dark fiber for rapid postearthquake response.},

  abstract = {Ground deformation observed using near-real time geodetic methods, such as InSAR and GPS, can provide critical information about the evolution of a magma chamber prior to volcanic eruption. Rapid advancement in numerical modeling capabilities has resulted in a number of finite element models targeted at better understanding the connection between surface uplift associated with magma chamber pressurization and the potential for volcanic eruption. Robust model-data fusion techniques are necessary to take full advantage of the numerical models and the volcano monitoring observations currently available. In this study, we develop a 3D data assimilation framework using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) approach in order to combine geodetic observations of surface deformation with geodynamic models to investigate volcanic unrest. The EnKF sequential assimilation method utilizes disparate data sets as they become available to update geodynamic models of magma reservoir evolution. While the EnKF has been widely applied in hydrologic and climate modeling, the adaptation for volcano monitoring is in its initial stages. As such, our investigation focuses on conducting a series of sensitivity tests to optimize the EnKF for volcano applications and on developing specific strategies for assimilation of geodetic data. Our numerical experiments illustrate that the EnKF is able to adapt well to the spatial limitations posed by GPS data and the temporal limitations of InSAR, and that specific strategies can be adopted to enhance EnKF performance to improve model forecasts. Specifically, our numerical experiments indicate that: (1) incorporating additional iterations of the EnKF analysis step is more efficient than increasing the number of ensemble members; (2) the accuracy of the EnKF results are not affected by initial parameter assumptions; (3) GPS observations near the center of uplift improve the quality of model forecasts; (4) occasionally shifting continuous GPS stations to provide variability in the locations of observations results in better model predictions than utilizing fixed locations when the number of available instruments is limited; (5) spotty InSAR data coverage on the flanks of a volcano due to topographic shadows and/or atmospheric interference does not adversely impact the effectiveness of EnKF if the available coverage is {$>$}50\%; and (6) snow or glacial obstruction in the center of uplift can adversely impact EnKF forecasts. By utilizing these strategies, we conclude that the EnKF is an effective sequential model-data fusion technique for assimilating multiple geodetic observations to forecast volcanic activity at restless volcanoes.},

This UKF-based training algorithm has the merits of being more accurate and not calculating the derivatives when compared to the training algorithms based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Moreover, the UKF can converge more rapidly than the EKF, so the proposed UKF-based algorithm is more suitable for real-time implementation of neural training algorithms. At the end of the paper, the presented algorithm is applied to the XOR classification problem. The classification results demonstrate that the new UKF-based training algorithm performs well in solving the nonlinear XOR classification problem and has superiority over the EKF-based algorithm.},

In this study, the impact of SST forcing on the extended-range land-only global 2-m temperature, continental United States (CONUS) accumulated precipitation, and MJO skill are explored with version 11 of the GEFS (GEFSv11) under various SST forcing configurations. The configurations consist of 1) the operational GEFS 90-day e-folding time of the observed real-time global SST (RTG-SST) anomaly relaxed to climatology, 2) an optimal AMIP configuration using the observed daily RTG-SST analysis, 3) a two-tier approach using the CFSv2-predicted daily SST, and 4) a two-tier approach using bias-corrected CFSv2-predicted SST, updated every 24 h. The experimental period covers the fall of 2013 and the winter of 2013/14. The results indicate that there are small differences in the ranked probability skill scores (RPSSs) between the various SST forcing experiments. The improvements in forecast skill of the Northern Hemisphere 2-m temperature and precipitation for weeks 3 and 4 are marginal, especially for North America. The bias-corrected CFSv2-predicted SST experiment generally delivers superior performance with statistically significant improvement in spatially and temporally aggregated 2-m temperature RPSSs over North America. Improved representation of the SST forcing (AMIP) increased the forecast skill for MJO indices up through week 2, but there is no significant improvement of the MJO forecast skill for weeks 3 and 4. These results are obtained over a short period with weak MJO activity and are also subject to internal model weaknesses in representing the MJO. Additional studies covering longer periods with upgraded model physics are warranted.},

Using data from South California and Japan consisting of 440 earthquakes whose magnitudes range between 3 and 7.3, it is demonstrated that {$\tau$}log is better correlated with the catalog magnitude than the predominant period and provides better magnitude assessment than the characteristic period for small magnitudes (M{$<$}4). The average prediction error is reduced with increasing the input interval up to 6 s. It appears that a single linear scaling describes the relation between log({$\tau$}log) and the catalog magnitude for the entire magnitude range studied here.},

  abstract = {To provide quantitative information on the shear wave velocity structure of the \.Izmit Bay area, we conduct active\textendash passive array surface wave and single-station microtremor measurements at 60 sites. We process these array measurements to produce combined Rayleigh wave dispersion curves that span a broad-frequency range (0.5\textendash 20 Hz). We also make use of horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves obtained from the single-station microtremor measurements to benefit from their close relation to the ellipticity of Rayleigh waves. Using the dispersion curve sensitivity to the absolute velocities and the shape of the HVSR curve sensitivity to the velocity contrasts of the velocity-depth model, we have applied a combined inversion technique to derive better constrained shear velocity models at each site. The derived shear velocity models are used to provide a Vs30 site classification map and information on the sediment-bedrock structure for the \.Izmit Bay area. The Vs30 map shows that the entire shoreline regions including artificial infill areas of the \.Izmit Bay have Vs30 values less than 200 m s-1, locally as low as 80 m s-1. The older sediment areas of the \.Izmit basin have Vs30 values ranging between 250 and 350 m s-1. The highest Vs30 values are associated with rock sites reaching about 950\textendash 1300 m s-1. We also present a high correlation between the Vs30 values and the phase velocity of Rayleigh wave corresponding to the 40 m wavelength (C40). The important implication of this correlation is that Vs30 may be estimated from C40 without inverting the dispersion curve. The inferred sediment-bedrock interface along a cross-section shows an antisymmetric V shaped basin with a sedimentary cover thickness reaching about 1200 m at the deepest part of the \.Izmit basin. This deepest part coincides in the map view where the North Anatolian fault zone crosses the basin in the east\textendash west direction. The sedimentary cover thickness is found to be 750 m in the G\"olc\"uk\textendash Derince basin.},
