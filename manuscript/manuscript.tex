\section*{Introduction}

The amount and rate of heat emitted by a volcano provides important clues about
volcanic processes at depth. For example, a sudden rise in the heat output rate
combined with increased microgravity signals may result from the emplacement of
fresh magma at shallow depth \cite{Brown1991}. A slow decrease in the heat
emission rate together with a high carbon-sulfur ratio of the emitted gas may
point to the formation of a hydrothermal seal.

Volcanic lakes help with estimating heat emissions. Often, the majority of a
volcano's heat and gas output passes through the crater lake. Crater lakes act thus
like a filter, integrating heat and gas input from the vents entering the lake.

Monitoring changes in temperature, water mass, and ion concentration in these
lakes can thus serve as proxies for changes in gas- and steam-release by the
hydrothermal system and, ultimately, the melt zone beneath the volcano. 

Crater Lake (Te Wai A-Moe) on Mt. Ruapehu, an active andesitic stratovolcano in
the center of New Zealand's North Island (Figure \ref{overview}), is one such
example with records of observations dating back to the 19th century
\citep[e.g.][]{Friedlander1898}. Mt. Ruapehu erupted at least 602 times since
1830 with many phreatic and phreato-magmatic eruptions and two major magmatic
episodes \citep{Scott2013}. Although the latest magmatic event between June
1995 to November 1997 and a subsequent dam collapse changed the shape and
volume of the lake, it has been largely unchanged since then and the lake's
bathymetry is well known from times when it was empty [Tony Hurst, personal
communication].

Increases in heat and steam input may be caused by the ascent of magma or
changes in the permeability of the hydrothermal system and are, therefore,
important parameters to be monitored. First attempts to quantify the amount of
heat and steam entering the lake date back to \citep{Dibble1966}. Over the past
decade water temperature and lake level have been monitored continuously
and water samples for ion concentration measurements have been taken roughly
every two to three months. This enables us to continuously estimate heat and
steam input into the lake and, in principle, automatically detect changes in
these variables as soon as they occur.

Inference of the heat and steam input is typically done through a mass and
energy balance calculation: the sum of mass and energy flow into and out of the
lake has to account for the observed changes in lake temperature, water level
and ion dilution \citep[e.g.,][]{Hurst1981, Hurst1991, Stevenson1992,
Fournier2009, Scott1994}. At Crater Lake, and probably at most other volcanic
lakes, this is an underdetermined problem, that is the number of unknowns
exceeds the number of constraints. Hence, it is necessary to constrain some of
the parameters in the mass and energy balance model using prior knowledge. Further,
some observations and input parameters come with large uncertainties and are sampled
irregularly.

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
 E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
\biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
\frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
